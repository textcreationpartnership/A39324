            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Judges and Barons of the Exchequer, the Kings privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and his learned Councel were summoned also, but <hi>neque tenurae, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que dignitatis ratione,</hi> and they made no Proxies for they had no voice.</p>
               <p>The Knights of the Shires.</p>
               <p>The Barons of the Cinque Ports.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93671:9"/> The Citizens &amp; Burgesses were ever elected and sent to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Officers, as the Clerk of the Crown.</p>
               <p>The Clerk of the Parliament, and the gentleman-Usher attended <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione officii</hi> without any summons.</p>
               <p>Whether the Summons were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently by one general Writ or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Writs.</p>
               <p>It appears in that Antient Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, <hi>Modus tenendi Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> That Arch-Bishops, Abbots, and Pryors which held by <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, summoneri debent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Minores Clerici nec minores laici non summoneri debent, sed si corum pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentia necessaria fuerat, Rex solebat talibus brevia sua mittere, Rogand. quod Parliamentum suum interessent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it may be gathered, that in those times, <hi>viz.</hi> before the Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quest, the Lords spiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and the Peers were summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Parliament by one general Summons, and that the others who were neither Lords nor Peers had particular Writs, but it is unlikely that <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror</hi> did send
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93671:9"/> out such Summons to the Lords: For how could the antient Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage (who were translated by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to the Normans) take notice thereof, their Lands, and Honors being seised for the King? It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he sent particular Writs of of Summons to his Normans (new created Lords) and to such English (if any) as he continued in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But as touching the Peers. Their Summons during his time continued as before, for it follows in the same Charter, <hi>Et praeterea faciemus sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneri in generali per vice-comites &amp; ballivos nostros omnes alios qui in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite tenent, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>By these tenants <hi>in Capite,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand those onely who held land <hi>in capite</hi> of the King (<hi>Ad valentiam unius comitatus, vel Baroniae integrae,</hi> as it is in that antient Manuscript, <hi>modus tenendi Parliamentum</hi>) and they are there named Peers.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93671:10"/>
               <p>Divers learned Heralds not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any difference between the <hi>Lords</hi> and their Peers have run into these errors, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> that all heretofore came to Parliament who had Lands of an entire County or Barony, and that <hi>Henry</hi> the third, having smarted by such a confused company of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, did (after the battail of <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham</hi>) first ordain, that those Earls and Barons to whom he directed his writs, should only come to Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, for which they vouch no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, but only the first Writ of Summons extant, <hi>Ann.</hi> 49. <hi>H.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>December,</hi> and affirm the same to be after the battail of <hi>Evesham,</hi> &amp; that this was the first time that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons were called by special Writs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> that the Writ of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons did create a Baron.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the first Writ did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble the person so created, and if the Son was also summoned, then the blood was ennobled.</p>
               <p>Not observing the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Peers &amp; Barons, the one being admitted <hi>ad libitum regis,</hi> the other
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93671:10"/> never if once created, being of full age, within the Land, and <hi>Rectus in Curia,</hi> as shall be declared hereafter in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> first of these is easily refuted and satisfied, for the practice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be otherwise touching the Earls and Barons in the time of King <hi>John,</hi> as by the aforesaid Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Mathew Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> the very date of the Writs which are vouched, proves, that the practise was also in <hi>H.</hi> 3. time, who began his Raign the <hi>xixth.</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and the Writs of Summons bear date in <hi>December,</hi> and the battail of <hi>Evesham</hi> 49. <hi>H.</hi> 3. happily this King did first ordain that no Peer should come to Parliament, unless such as had particular Writs of Summons, and therefore the Heralds are to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> excused, for the Peers once Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, have been reputed Lords of Parliament, and the Peers have been anciently stiled Barons, Vide Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Titles of Honour:</hi> That <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> saith, that <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. did number 250 of his Barons (who were as I conceive, <hi>Barones
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93671:11"/> minores</hi> or Peers) and not those who were Barons by Inheritance, whom <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> in the other place stiles <hi>Barons Majores,</hi> for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attained to that number: Also by this word (Peers) are understood all the Lords spiritual and temporal in the second Parliament of 15. <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1. <hi>E.</hi> 3. touching the banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Spencers;</hi> so that the Heralds might easily be deceived therein, especially since the Writs unto Barons and Peers, were all one, and they were ranked together promiscuously in the Book of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and some Peers placed there above antient Barons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> of this <hi>(viz.)</hi> that Peers were summoned, and omitted again <hi>(ad libitum Regis)</hi> And that Barons were ever created by Investiture of Robes, and that the Writ only did create a Baron, and that the first Writ did enoble both the person &amp; blood of him that was created: more shall be said hereafter in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the title of Omission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here</hi> I will only remember that this word <hi>(Baron)</hi> was anciently a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93671:11"/> general name to all those that held power of Judicature) as well as to the Parliament Barons: the Free-holders in a Court Baron were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently named Barons, and that Court stiled (<hi>Curia Baronum</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of them, and not <hi>(Curia Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronis)</hi> as now in respect of the Lord of the Mannor; and the Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> were anciently so named, and that they of the <hi>Cinque ports</hi> retain it to this day, and so do the Barons of the Exchequer who were first called <hi>(Sagi Barones)</hi> for they were, <hi>sagaces ad Compotes recipien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos &amp; allocandos.</hi>

               <p>Wherefore we will and command you forthwith upon the Receipt hereof, and by Warrant of the same, to cause such and so many Writs to be made and sealed under Our great Seal for the accomplishment of the same, as in like Cases hath been heretofore used and accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: And this Bill signed with our hand, shall be as well unto you, as to every such Clark and Clarks, as shall make, or passe the same, a sufficient Warrant in that behalf.

               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Warrant is generall, and directs not the Lord Chancellor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom he shall direct the Writs of Summons, nor to omit any that were summoned the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And yet it is apparent that many Lords (though living) have been omitted, and that the Father who hath been often summoned in his life time, being dead, his son
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93671:23"/> nor none of his posterity have ever been after summoned.</p>
               <p>This gives more occasion to shew what right the Nobility have had to be summoned, and upon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions they have been omitted.</p>
               <p>First for their Right, the King at this day inserts into the patent of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Baron, that he should be summoned to Parliament, so that the question doth rest only upon those Barons who had no patent of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the Earles had Charters, and no doubt was ever made of them. The doubt ariseth out of this, that divers Lords have been called by Writs, the onely thing left us recorded to know them; for anciently they had no Patents, and yet their sons and posterity wholly omitted, for it may seem it rests meerly in the Kings will to call them again, or wholly omit them, and that they had no right to be called by their Creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To</hi> satisfie this, let us consider of the creation of Earls (of whom there was no doubt) and of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:93671:24"/>
               <p>It cannot be denyed, but that Earls were ever created by an actual Ceremony, and that ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had no Charter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mandevile</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> being the first that had any (as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion is) there being none extant before his time; now the question is, whither the honour passe by creation without the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or no, as I suppose it did, and that the Charter was to convey the Jurisdiction anciently, and of lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, the third penny of the County, rather then for the honour; and for this cause happily divers Earls used to renew their Charters at the change of the Prince, not to renew their honour, but to confirm the grant of the Jurisdiction, or third penny of the County from the Crown; wherefore I may affirm that the ceremony of Investiture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> created the Earl, and the Charter of the Earldom.</p>

               <p>These are extant with Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Cotten, Anno</hi> 1626. And if Charters had been usually enrolled in those times, when the Jurisdiction of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was granted unto the Earl, We should have had many more presidents.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>TOuching</hi> Barons by creation, I do here intend those onely who have had no patent (as now they have) but were anciently crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an actual Ceremony, even as Earls anciently were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No</hi> ancient Record can be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that any degree of honour did passe (no not among the barbarous Nations) without actual ceremony. Knighthood did ever require it, which is the lowest. And therefore I cannot conceive, but that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Barons were created first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had their Writs, and then having once been called by Writ, they had as good right for them and their posterity to be summoned ever after as the Earls had, so they kept their land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To</hi> prove that Barons were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ceremony, examine the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. to the Lord <hi>John Beauchamp</hi> of <hi>Holt,</hi> which some Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries affirme to be the first Patent of the creation of a Baron: the words
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93671:25"/> are <hi>(Ipsum Johannem in unum Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um &amp; Baronum Regni nostri Angliae prefecimus) volentes quod idem Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes, &amp; haered. masculi de corpore suo exeuntes statum Baronis obtineant, ac domini de Beauchamp &amp; Barones de Kidermaster nuncupentur: In cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus rei testimonium,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teste Rege apud</hi> Westminst. 10 <hi>die Octob.</hi> It is strange to me that any should think that this Patent should create the Lord <hi>Beauchamp</hi> a Baron.</p>
               <p>It wants the very words of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it saith <hi>(Praefecimus)</hi> we have created, and not <hi>per praesentes praefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus,</hi> we do now create him: so that out of all doubt he was created before, and the King by this Patent onely limitted the honour to his heirs Males as <hi>H.</hi> 6 did in the first Writ of Summons to <hi>Bromflet,</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Vessey, Anno</hi> 27 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Clause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if <hi>Beauchamp</hi> were created before this Patent, the question is how he was created. I answer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Patent nor by Writ: For the Patent is dated the 10<seg rend="sup">th</seg> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and created him not: And his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93671:26"/> first Writ was in <hi>December</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is a good conclusion in my opinion, that he was created a Baron by Investiture of Robes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had either patent or Writ.</p>

And that therefore others were suddenly created by Writ to convict the remainder of those Rebels the foundation of this errour is built upon a false ground. For that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. was summoned before the battle of <hi>Evesham;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To</hi> consider the deliverance of the Kings eldest son who was then a prisoner: and <hi>Mountford</hi> Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> (chief Rebel) had his sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons also, and divers others who were slain at that Battail on his part.</p>
               <p>If the Writ without Investiture of Robes did enoble the party, then
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93671:26"/> were all the Judges, the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants at Law, divers Deans, and Arch-Deacons (being Treasurers or Keepers of the Privy Seal) or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise of the Kings Council, eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in divers Parliaments of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. almost in all Parliaments of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. and many of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. For they had then one and the self-same Writ as the Earls and Barons had. The Kings two Escheators have had the same Writ, <hi>Annis</hi> 12. &amp; 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. I grant that divers have been called by Writ, and had the same VVrit the Barons had, yea, and were ranked in the Close Rolls (by the Chancery Clerk) above di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ancient Barons, and afterwards omitted: But I deny that such were Barons, they were but <hi>Peers:</hi> For such men anciently also summoned to Parliament, amongst the rest, I will cite one, <hi>(viz.) Monuthermer,</hi> who having married the VVidow of the Earl of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great part of the Earldom as her joynture, was summoned as an Earl during the minority of her son by <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. And when the son came to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93671:27"/> Age, <hi>Monuthermer</hi> was summoned as a Baron, but his son and posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty omitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may be objected, how these Peers could be discerned from the Barons, their Writs being all one?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, by their manner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; for the Barons appeared in their Robes, such as they had at their creation; the Peers did not, for they had none (or such as were far different from the Barons a Robes,) Surely no, for it had been disgrace to him afterwards to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Barons Robes, when he came but as Baron. It plainly appears that he was summoned <hi>Ratione te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurae tantum &amp; non nobilitatis Ergo,</hi> and so had no Robes.</p>

               <p>I doubt not but the Heralds will affirme that <hi>Ralph Camois</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, yea, and this <hi>Thomas Camois</hi> were Barons: But how will they then answer the Record of 7 <hi>R.</hi> 2. who saith they were <hi>Bannerets,</hi> a Title given to the Peers of that age, as that of <hi>Milites</hi> was in the time of <hi>E.</hi> 1.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93671:28"/> conceive, leaving others to their own better judgements, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moys</hi> was called to Parliament 3. discents, yet not being created a Baron by Investiture of Robes, but onely called by VVrit; he was but called a Barons Peer, and no Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. And it seems to me that those Claims of priviledge not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannelled of a Jury which occurre in our Year-books, were made by Peers, and not by Barons; For the tryal was by Record, whether sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned or not, and not by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds for their Creation: For it is impossible but a Sheriffe of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty should know a Baron of the same Shire by creation (if he were the first;) his appearance in the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in Robes, and the Hatchments at his Fathers Funeral, if it descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto him, would be so notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the Sheriff of the same Shire could not so mistake, as to impan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell him of a Jury, and the Bailiff dwelling in the same, hindered to warn him to appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know</hi> that the word <hi>Peers</hi> in two <hi>Parliaments</hi> of 15 <hi>E.</hi> 2. did
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93671:28"/> signifie the Lords Spirituall, and Temporall, and all that had voyce in <hi>Parliament</hi> according to the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word. And in the 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. all that were to be tryed by <hi>Peers</hi> 9. the Temporall Lords one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but in all the ancient Statutes (penned by the Judges, and the Kings Serjeants) the Earls and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons are so named, or else <hi>Magnates.</hi> And this word <hi>Peers</hi> is not found in any of them, save in those of 15 <hi>E</hi> 2. Touching the banishment of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> whether did any of those Lords who were impannelled of a Jury, challenge the name or title of a Baron, <hi>Vide Brooks Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Tit. Challenge, N.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>The Cause alledged is, for that he was Banneret &amp; Lord of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and had place there, and so ought not to be of a Jury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> may it not be that he who was summoned to the <hi>Parliament</hi> as a Baron, during his life, also had voyce in <hi>Parliament,</hi> why not privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd out of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> why may not so much be granted unto him as to a Banneret, not to be chosen
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93671:29"/> Knight of the Shire? the Banneret might be summoned to the upper House, and therefore (in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) ought not to serve in the lower House? why not the other priviledge upon the same reason? The very tryall upon such <hi>Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> was whether summoned or not.</p>
               <p>Not whether a Baron, or no Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, which satisfies me, that they were no Barons, but Peers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing summoned, had the priviledges of Barons, both for that, and to be tryed by Peers, but were not so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</p>
               <p>Here may be a doubt, whether the Barons and Peers took place in the <hi>Parliament-House,</hi> as they were ranked in the Lists of Summons, then did <hi>Richardus de Camoys,</hi> being but a <hi>Peer,</hi> take place, <hi>Anno</hi> 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. above all <hi>Barons:</hi> and so <hi>Thomas Camoys</hi> the Grandchild was ranked, <hi>Anno</hi> 17 <hi>R.</hi> 2. and after for divers <hi>Parliaments</hi> above all <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.</hi> If you peruse those ancient Summons, you shall not find any one of them ranked aright.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93671:34"/> no right, they took place accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the antiquity of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, and were not new created, which shews is the honor is Inherita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Nay, if the chief Seat had been conveyed to the Heire Male, and he summoned to Parliament, he took place according to the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the barony.</p>
               <p>And as the barons honor is Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, so their comming to Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament hath ever been reckoned an essential point of Inheritable honor, as given them by the King at their first Creation (though not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as now in their late Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) And to deny that unto any one, that is due unto them all is to dishonour him whom the Majesty of a King hath formerly honoured, whereof our Kings have ever been very Religious; witness the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of <hi>Roger de Quincye,</hi> second Son to <hi>Sayer</hi> Earl of <hi>Winch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ster,</hi> whom <hi>H.</hi> 3. summoned to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, supposing that <hi>Robert</hi> his Elder brother (then in the holy Land) had been dead, and would
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93671:34"/> not afterwards displace him, when his eldest brother returned, and petitioned for his right, because he had been lawfully summoned to parliament, and there, and in other places had been void, whereby (saith the precedent) the title of honour was setled, as inheritance in him; it was unjust, but yet to preserve the honour which the King had given.</p>
               <p>There is another pleasing prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Mounthermer,</hi> whom <hi>E.</hi> 1. called to parliament, as Earl of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> for that he had married the widow, and had a great part of the Land, &amp; when <hi>Gilbert</hi> the Heir came to Age, and petitioned for his Right, <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. granted it, yet sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned <hi>Mounthermer</hi> ever after as a baron; so unwilling the King was to dishonour him. Out of these precedents and my observation of all the summons in general which <hi>I</hi> have carefully perused, it appears plainly to me, that the Lords have a double Right to be summoned to the parliament; one gotten by long continuance and use, and another
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93671:35"/> given by the King with their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at their creation; (neither can <hi>I</hi> find) having made diligent search that any Baron hath been omitted, if he were of full age, stood <hi>(Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in Curia)</hi> and were within the Land, unlesse he had so diminished his Revenews, as that he could not maintain the state of his honour, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reof there are some few unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing precedents, but such cannot be produced of any Earl, for at his creation the King gave him for his Maintenance, the third penny of the County, which could not be alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

Few Earls and Barons were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, the King then being in his French Warres, And such omission was thought to be no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their honour.</p>
               <p>But now since the opinion, that Omission to be summoned did lose their Right hath been broached by the not discerning of Peers from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93671:36"/> Barons; every Lord is carefull to be summoned, though he know he cannot appear, being beyond the Seas. As when the Lord <hi>Mountjoye</hi> was Deputy in <hi>Ireland, Anno</hi> 43. <hi>Eliz.</hi> he had his VVrit, and sent his Proxie.</p>
               <p>Others have been omitted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did not stand <hi>Rectus in Curia,</hi> either their title was <hi>Liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> as was the Earl of <hi>Arundels, Anno</hi> 11. <hi>H.</hi> 6. And the late Lord of <hi>Abergavenneyes;</hi> or they were restrained of their liberty, being in the Kings displeasure, as was the Earl of <hi>Northumberland, Anno.</hi> xviij. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> For then the VVrit of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is an Enlargement by Law as was resolved by the Judges.</p>
               <p>But I do not find any ancient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent that any had their Writs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed them, for that they were in the Kings displeasure onely.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Anno</hi> 15. <hi>E.</hi> 3. the King was highly displeased with the Arch Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> yet he had his Writ, and came to Parliament, and humbled himself unto the King, desiring to be tryed by his Peers.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:93671:36"/>
               <p>It is true, this Arch Bishop was at the first denyed his Entrance into the Parliament House, yet at the Intercession of the Lords, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; <hi>Vide plus de Antiquitate Ecclesiae Brittanniae, &amp; Goodwin in vita sanct. Archiepiscop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> was summoned to the Parliament, to be held at <hi>Coventry</hi> 28. <hi>December,</hi> Notwithstanding he was suspected to be privy to the treason of <hi>Hottspur</hi> his son.</p>
               <p>This Parliament was prorogued <hi>Cra. Hill.</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> &amp; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations being then by new Writs, the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> had none, yet he came to Parliament, exhibited his petition, wherein he acknowledged that he had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Allegiance, and namely for gathering of men, and giving of Liveries against the statute, was tryed by his Peers, who adjudged his action to be neither Felony nor Treason, but onely a trespasse fina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the King, which the King pardoned. Now of late they which are in the Kings displeasure, have
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93671:37"/> had their summons, but with a Letter from the Lord Chancellour, or Lord Keeper (not to come out, but) to send a Proxie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> in the Parliament of the 6. of <hi>February, Anno Caroli Rs.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> being denyed his Writ, petitioned the Parliament for it, then he had his Writ without any intercession of the Parliament Lords: But withall, a Letter from the Lord Keeper signifying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties pleasure, that he forbear to come, and send his Proxy; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Earl petitions the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again, shewing that that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could not discharged him from coming, the Writ commanding him to come upon his Allegiance: but this point was not then decided, for the Earl was presently sent for as a <hi>Delinquent,</hi> and charged with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; <hi>Omission. ratione Minoritatis,</hi> there be many presidents for it, as of young <hi>Gilbert de Clare,</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> in the last year of <hi>E.</hi> 1. But the King hath sent his Writ of Summons unto such, before they were fully xxi. being of years of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,

                  <seg rend="sup">o</seg> 15. yet neither of their summons, were entered.</p>
               <p>As the King hath not used to omit any Lord that hath been within the Land <hi>(Rectus in Curia)</hi> &amp; of full age, so none have used to come to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, until he had received his VVrit of summons: But in such case he may send to the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor for his VVrit, as the Earl <hi>Marshall</hi> delivered his opinion in the case between <hi>Nevill,</hi> and <hi>Fane, Anno Eliz.</hi> The reason may be for that the Lord Chancellors war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants are general, <hi>Vide</hi> the Journall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93671:38"/> book, <hi>Anno</hi> xxixth of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Parliament began the 24th. of <hi>October,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> came not, for that he received not his Writ (through the negligence of the Messenger) saith the Journal, until the xviij. of <hi>November,</hi> His Lordship was then sick, and appeared not until the 11th. of <hi>January</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>WHere</hi> the Barony discends unto an Heir Female, the husband of such an Heir hath been omitted untill he hath had Issue Male by her, and be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his Petition of Grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, <hi>quia,</hi> the use hath been so; yet being admitted &amp; sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, he taketh place according to the antiquity of that Barony. I speak of Barons by Creation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture and Writ onely, without any Patent. And this shews plainly that a Baron so created and summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, his honour is inheritable.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, That some Baronies discended unto an Heir Female, and her Husband and posterity ever after omitted. And some Baronies have discended unto two Sisters or more, and the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the elder sister wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the younger husband sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="sup">o</seg> such honour is not inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table but during the life of the Issue male.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:93671:40"/>
               <p>I answ. This may happen upon divers occasions: for 1<seg rend="sup">o</seg> besides the discent of honour, a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Knights Fees ought to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend also for the maintenance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Husband cannot be summoned <hi>de jure,</hi> untill he hath Issue Male, and petitioned for it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the Husband neglect his Petition, the Issue Male is to make his Claim by Petition to the King.</p>
               <p>If any of these fail, the Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is just; and yet the honour is inheritable to the heir female, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise how could Sir <hi>Humphrey Bowcher,</hi> who marryed the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger daughter of the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> be admitted unto the ancient place of that Barony.</p>

               <p>But when the Commons gave their answer touching the Subsidie demanded for the Wars, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired leave to return into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to confer with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, promising their endeavours for the same at the next Parliament: And withall, desired that the Writ to the Sheriffs for Election of the Knights might have this Clause, <hi>viz.

This shews the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Appearance being so summoned.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The appearance of the first day of Parliament.</head>
               <p>FIrst, Let us consider which is the first day of the Parliament: Then their manner of Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>The Writ shews the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Parliament is to begin: And anciently, though the King, and but a few of the Lords appeared then, but the Parliament was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed in expectance of the rest,
<pb facs="tcp:93671:50"/> yet that was reckoned the first day of the Parliament, If his Majesty were present, <hi>prout</hi> 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis sanct. Hillarii. &amp;</hi> 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. in Lent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. xv <hi>Pasch.</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Parliaments in his time, and in his Successors <hi>R.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>If the Parliament be prorogued, for that the King cannot intend it the same day, new Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were sent out anciently, and another day appointed, <hi>prout Anno</hi> 23 <hi>E.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Novemb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 23 <hi>E.</hi> 1. 13 <hi>Julij, Anno</hi> 11 <hi>E.</hi> 2. 3 <hi>Martij, et An.</hi> 6 <hi>E.</hi> 1. 11 <hi>Decemb.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>At this day if the Parliament be summoned, the day is appointed in the Writs, but if the same be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued by Writ patent (as the manner is now) and another day appointed; that is reckoned the first day when the King is present, and the cause of Summons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>Of this the precedents happen so daily I need not recite any.</p>
               <p>This may be the Rule; that is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93671:50"/> the first day of the Parliament, when the King himself is first present, and this agrees both with the ancient and modern times.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The first dayes Appearance.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>NO</hi> Records speak of such so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity as is used at this day, neither could it be with that State, the King lying in the same house, and his Lodgings neer the same rooms where the Parl. was kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> it plainly appears by many Records of <hi>E.</hi> 3. That on the first day of the Parliament, a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made in <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall, the Record sayes <hi>(Feast Crie fait)</hi> by the Kings Commandment; That all that were summoned to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should repair to the painted Chamber, and so the Parliament began, that being reckoned the first day, though so few appeared: And it was adjourned to another day in expectation of the rest, <hi>prout An.</hi> 37, 38. 40. 43. 45. 47. 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Here could be no solemn procession to the Parliament in such state as is now used.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:93671:51"/>
               <p>But here may rise a question how it should be known who were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, by which word was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently understood the Commons as well as the Lords and Peers.</p>
               <p>I answer, the Commons were called by the Returns of the Sheriffs, the Lords were admitted in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Robes, not being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Investiture as the Earls and Barons were (<hi>prout</hi> in the former Chapter) and they were all called in the House by the Clerks Roll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King came. That the Lords were called, may be inferred by this, that the Parliaments have been often adjourn'd the first day, because they were not all come, which could not otherwise be known but by the Call, so that they were called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was adjourned: And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears they were called the first day before the King came to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 18 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n</hi>
                  <seg rend="sup">o</seg> 5. which Parl. was adjourned also the first day for lack of appearance; and after the adjournment, and after the names of the Receivers and Tryers of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, there is entered this Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:93671:51"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> Let the names of the Lords who are summoned to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament be viewed, read, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before the King in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this day; and of them that are not come, let their names be delivered to the King in writing to ordain such punishment as he shall please; which shews plainly that the King was not present before when the Lords were called, for then this had been needless.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> next doubt is, In what place the Commons were called; The Record of <hi>R.</hi> 2. saith, that the Knights and Burgesses were called by name in presence of the King, which shews they stayed without till then.</p>
               <p>And 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Consimile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. The Knights and Burgesses were called at the door of the painted Chamber in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Steward of the Kings house as the manner is.</p>
               <p>And at this day they are called by their names by the Clark of the Crown in the presence of the Lord Steward in the Court of Requests,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93671:52"/> whereof there are many precedents in Qu. <hi>Eliz.</hi> time.</p>
               <p>Onely one precedent differs from all the latter <hi>(viz.)</hi> that of the 33 of <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Primo die Parliamenti,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> then Lord Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, commanded the Clerk of the Parl. to read the names of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, unto which every one answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they being all in the Upper House below the Bar, and then the King came.</p>
               <p>Now since the fifth year of Qu. <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Commons take the Oath of Supremacy; and since the third year of King <hi>James,</hi> they take the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> also, which the Lord Steward administers unto some, and appoints certain of them his deputies, to give the same unto the rest.</p>
               <p>The Lords are not called the first day, but have used to deliver their Writs onely to the Clerk of the Parliament: And the third day of the Parliam. the Summons being declared, and the Speaker being presented by the Commons; the second day the Lords are called by
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93671:52"/> the Clerk of the Parliament, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the lowest Baron, and so ascending to the highest, and the Proxies and other excuses (if any of the absent Lords) registred. Here I must confess one of my own <hi>Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's:</hi> For being suddenly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to call the House, <hi>Anno</hi> 21 <hi>Jae.</hi> and unprovided of a Catalogue of their names, I made use of one then delivered me by the Earl Marshall, and began at the upper end with the Prince, and so discended: I quickly found mine own Errour, but none else perceived it. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, which I observed here lest my Successors mistake also by that precedent</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>When the LORDS are to appear in their Robes.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe</hi> Heraulds can give the best satisfaction when the King and the Lords did first go to the Parliament in such solemn manner as now, I have a precedent thereof in my Uncle <hi>Boyers</hi> Collections of Honour and Armes: I doubt not but the Lords did ever appear in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93671:53"/> their Robes the first day, whereof we have no Parliament Records be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Journal books of <hi>H.</hi> 8. all the former being lost.</p>
               <p>The Lords appear in their <hi>Robes</hi> also, whensoever the King is present (if their Lordships have notice thereof.)</p>
               <p>And when their Lordships give judgment, and when the King gives the Royal assent to any one Bill or more by his Letters Patents, or sends a Commission to adjorn, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue, or dissolve the Parliament.</p>
               <p>And in those cases the Lords sit all in their due places untill the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission be read, and then the Lords Commissioners are to sit on formes overthwart the upper end of the House to execute their Commission.</p>
               <p>Note this to be understood of such adjornment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as the King himself hath used to be present at in person <hi>(viz)</hi> of Adjornments, Prorogations, or Dissolutions of Parliament <hi>(sedente Curia)</hi> But if the Parliament be adjourned, or Prorogued <hi>(Sedente Curia)</hi> and afterwards the King by

                  <hi>Proclamation</hi> prorogue the same to a further day (which happens oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en) in those cases the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners appear not in their Robes, for that the King himself never used to be present at any such adjournment in person.</p>
               <p>If a Lord of Parliament either by the misprision of the Clerk or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, be not ranked in his due place, and complains thereof, the House appoints a Committee to search the Records for his due place, whereunto he is admitted without any other Ceremony, for that he is in the House already; <hi>prout</hi> the Earl of <hi>Surrey, Anno</hi> 6 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 15 <hi>Febr.</hi>

               <p>And it were very fit the Lords did continue this order to deliver their first Writs to the Clerk to be entred: For it records their pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as well as the time of their first coming to Parl.</p>
               <p>If a Lord of Parliament dyes <hi>(sedente Curia)</hi> and his Heir be summoned, he appears also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ceremony; onely his first Writ is entred, and the day of his

               </p>
               <p>And I have observed that divers Bishops have been summoned after the parliament is begun, in place of another Bishop who was dead, and onely delivered his writ to the Clerk to be entred without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ceremony, which was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved also in former time, <hi>prout An.</hi> 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 23. and 27 <hi>March, Episc.

               <p>If the eldest son of any Earl be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summoned as a Baron after the Parliament is begun, he is to be brought in his Robes between those two Lords, between whom he is to

               </p>
               <p>And I remember well that the old Earl of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full both for the right place of his son, and the ancient ceremonies to be used at his sons first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>The reason why Garter King at Arms is to wait, and wear his Coat but half way on, is for that his Lordship is in expectance of an Earldom, when Garter is to do him further service, and to wear his Coat wholly on.</p>

               </p>
               <p>With this agrees that with the 6 of E 3 at the Parliament held at <hi>Yorke. viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cause of Summons being touching <hi>Scotland</hi> the (prelates with the Clergy thereof by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) the Dukes and Barons by themselves) and afterwards they delivered their Joint-answer to the King.</p>
               <p>In the former Parliament of that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93671:57"/> year at <hi>Westminster Crastino Mariae,</hi> the cause was touching <hi>Ireland:</hi> the Prelates consulted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and after they gave a Joint-Answer, and they all joyned in one grant of a subsidie to the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 6. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Octabis Hillarii</hi> the Prelats treated by themselves, so did the Lords, and so did the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and afterwards their Joint-Answer was reported to the King by the Bishop of <hi>Winchester.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By these precedents it appears plainly that the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons did first meet together in one Room, and yet had divers Rooms to consult in, severally and apart.</p>
               <p>But this doth not directly and plainly prove that the Lords and Commons did sit together in one Room.</p>
               <p>The cause of Summons was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to them altogether touching an aid for the King, they conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereof and joined in grant of the subsidie upon condition to have their petitions granted, a joint Committee of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are appointed to sit upon the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93671:58"/> said petitions from day to day un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they be dispatched and reduced into the form of a statute, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitees are named as well the Lords as the Commons.</p>
               <p>Yet the two Houses sat apart: also that Parliament, for many things are recorded to be done by the Lords, whereunto the Commons were not joyned.</p>
               <p>It is more of curiosity then of necessity to search for the truth of this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 50. E. 3. the cause of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ended, the Commons were willed to withdraw themselves to their ancient place in the Chapter House of the Abbot of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and there to treat and consult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves.</p>
               <p>This shewes plainly that they had a place assigned them of old to sit in apart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> when the King pleaseth, he may have the Lords and Commons sit together in one place, as they did <hi>Anno</hi> 7 <hi>Jacobi</hi> in the Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, the Lords sitting on the right hand by themselves, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

               <p>I Have heard it often mentioned whether the Commons did sit anciently with the Lords or no.</p>
               <p>I will not resolve this doubt, for no Record can be produced on the one side or on the other, so that the usage must direct us how it was in former times: And since the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons do in other Matters enjoy more ample priviledges at this day then the ancient Records mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, divers privy Councellors, and others of the Kings servants being now of that house, from whence they were formerly exempted, (<hi>prout</hi> in the 1 Chapter) it is not likely that such honourable person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages would have waved this one priviledge, and stand in a crowd if they might have claimed a seat for their ease, which they never did Claim <hi>temporibus H.</hi> 8. <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>P. et M</hi> nor of Q.

               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:93671:59"/>
               <p>It will be said that heretofore a Cōmittee of the Lords have come into the house of Commons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with them, which was used even in <hi>Anno</hi> 3. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and there no doubt the Commons did sit and the Lords with them.</p>
               <p>It is true, that this happened som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times but was not constantly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Lords did <hi>(discedere de fac.)</hi> to go thither, as it is resolved <hi>Anno.</hi> 2. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>pl.

               <head>Ʋnto whom Proxies may be made.</head>
               <p>A Proxy cannot be made to a Lord that is absent himself. <hi>Vide An.</hi> 38 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>In fine Libri</hi> Journal this entrance <hi>(viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Latimer</hi> sent his Proxy, which the Clerk received; but it was repealed by the Lord Chancellor, for that the Lord <hi>Latimers</hi> Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were not present.</p>
               <p>So if the Lord, unto whom the Proxy is made, be afterwards ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the Proxy is void; Yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Procurator be absent <hi>ex licentia Regis,</hi> and hath made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator also for himself, for the proxy is but an authority to give another mans assent, which cannot be transferred to a 3d. person. And therefore in such case the Lord <hi>Vaux</hi> made a 2d. proxy <hi>Anno.</hi> 18 <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobi
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93671:70"/> Regis,</hi> which I think was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to detain his particular Vote (a dignity particular to the Lords of Parl.) then to avoid the Kings displeasure: The first proxy being a sufficient excuse for his absence.</p>
               <p>Neither is it the use now to make proxies unto strangers who are no Members of the House, nor to any of the Attendants, as to the Judges, Barons of the Exchequer, or the like.</p>
               <p>Yet there are divers precedents that the Spiritual Lords have made proxies unto strangers; <hi>prout</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Selbye</hi> made <hi>John Goul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> a Monck of that house, and M <hi>Will: R. Clerk</hi> his Procurator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno E.</hi> 3. the year is not recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>And divers other precedents there are of this nature. The Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral had then the like right, and we may guess that they did make the like Proxies unto Strangers by this, that <hi>Anno</hi> 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. in <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Lent,</hi> Mouns. <hi>William Scot,</hi> and Mouns. <hi>Will: de la Pool</hi> were not summoned; and yet were appointed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93671:71"/> Tryers of Petitions, a matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Lords of the upper House:</p>
               <p>So we may guess they came with Proxies not of any Spiritual Lords (for they sent Clergymen) but of the Temporal Lords, for they have the title of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nsieur,</hi> which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth they were Laymen.</p>
               <p>So we may guess also that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de sanct: Paul, Monsieur John de Pultenye, Mons. Thomas Rookbie,</hi> came with Proxies to that Parl. for they were not summoned; and yet of divers Committees <hi>promiscue</hi> with other Lords in matters touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Flanders, Bruxels,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>

                  <seg rend="sup">o</seg>. 13, 14. &amp; 17. So that strangers had Proxies, place, and voice in Parl.</p>
               <p>But the question is, where they did sit? surely not in that Lords seat whose procurator he was; yet they do so at a general Councel or Dyet beyond the Seas.</p>

Hillar.</hi> Proclamation was made by the Kings commandment in <hi>Westminst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Hall, that all the Prelates, Lords and Commons who were come to the Parliament, should draw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the painted Chamber; and afterwards on the same day there being in the said Chamber the Chancellour, Treasurer, and some of the Prelates, Lords and Commons, who were come to the Parliament, Sir <hi>Henry Green</hi> the Kings Chief Justice told them in English, that the King is ready to begin his Parliament, but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Prelates, Lords, and Commons who are summoned are not yet come, wherefore the King willeth that they should depart and take their ease untill Munday. On which day the cause of Summons was declared by the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> then Chancellour, touching the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93671:76"/> of the Church, and the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the people.</p>
               <p>These are the Parliaments of <hi>Ed</hi> 3. that mentioned the Chief Justice.</p>
               <p>In all the subsequent Parliaments in his time, the cause of Summons was declared by the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and he hath been Speaker.</p>
               <p>Except that of 47 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. The summons was declared by Sir <hi>John Knevet</hi> Chancellor, and the next day Sir <hi>Guy Brian</hi> more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and that 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. where the cause touching Modern Affairs was declared by the Bishop of St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> the Chancellor, and the usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Pope by Monsieur <hi>Robert de Ashton</hi> the Kings Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain.</p>
               <p>Since <hi>E.</hi> 3 the Cause of Summons was ever declared by the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, if he were present, though the day after some others Matters have been opened unto the Lords and Commons, <hi>prout</hi> by the Steward of the Kings house.</p>

               <p>These ordinary matters are not entred usually in the Rolls of <hi>E.</hi> 3. yet by some we may guess at the rest.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93671:77"/> and Tryers of Petitions being read, he willed the Commons to put their advice in Writing, and deliver it to the King on Thursday following: so that he was Speaker, and yet the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> was Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and present; for the Record sayes, that he delivered the Lord of <hi>Arundels</hi> Petition unto the Clerk to be entred, <hi>N</hi>

               <p>And in all other Parliaments of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. when the Kings cause of Summons was declared by the Chief Justice, the Chancellor was then present as may appear by the Tryers of Petitions.</p>
               <p>So that in those Parliaments it cannot be said that the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93671:77"/> did supply the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors place (for that is properly when he is absent) but was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King to be Speaker that Parl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 29 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. The Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice declared that the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was that the cause of Summons should be declared by Monsieur <hi>Walter de Mannye,</hi> and so it was; Yet the Chief Justice managed the Parliament businesse as Speaker. For presently after Monsieur <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye</hi> his discourse, he called the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to advise thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and make ready their Petitions, <hi>N</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>And the petition of the Earl of <hi>March</hi> being read, it was said by Monsieur <hi>Will: Shareshall,</hi> and the Lords then present, with one minde, and one accord, that it seemed to them, That the Petition was good and reasonable to them, <hi>&amp;c. Ibid</hi> after the Petitions of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, here you see the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, ranked first above the Lords in delivering of their Votes.</p>
               <p>So that it is plain, the Chief
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93671:78"/> Justice managed the Parliament-businesse as Speaker of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appointed by the King, and that he did execute, (not supply) the place of the Chancellor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>For in such cases where the Chancellors place is supplyed, there when the Chancellour comes, he executes his office himself.</p>

               <p>In two Parliaments of <hi>H.</hi> 6. The Chancellors place was supplyed by a verball authority <hi>prout.</hi>

               <p>The cause of which Ceremony
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93671:79"/> may seem to be this; that as none but the King can call the Parliam. so it may appear that none but his Majestie can propound and direct wherefore it is called.</p>
               <p>And this Ceremony is ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by the Lord Chancellor, before he speak any thing in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when his Majesty is present.

               <p>In my opinion he ought to sit in his own proper place, untill he doth ariseth to confer with the King, and then to declare the same in the Lord Chancellors place, as he may be neer the King.

               <p>THat the Commons have ever had a Speaker, I think none will doubt; they needed none in the ancient times when both Houses sate together: But I shewed in the third Chapter that the Commons ever had a Speaker for their consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation apart from the Lords, though they did often meet and sit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one room, and then a Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was necessary, to avoyd confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of speech and Arguments.</p>

               <p>It can be no Argument that the Commons had no Speaker before the 51 <hi>E.</hi> 3. because no former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords mention him; for this is to be noted, that the ancient Rolls did record onely what Acts passed between both Houses, and what Laws were made, and omitted the Formes and Ceremonies then used.</p>

So that I do not marvel that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of E. 3 (which are the first Parliament Rolls now extant) do not mention the Speaker, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I may boldly affirm, that the Commons had their Speaker as well in the time of <hi>R.</hi> 2. when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent they had a Speaker though not mentioned in the Rolls <hi>(viz.)</hi> in all the parliaments between the 16. and the 17. <hi>R.</hi> 2.</p>

               <head>The Election of the Speaker.</head>
               <p>AT this day the cause of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons being declared, if by the K. (who in this learned age, hath ever delivered the same to the great admiration of hearers) The Lord Chancellor confers first with his Majestie and then in his name commands the Commons to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their house, and to choose one of their Members to be their Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93671:84"/> and to present him to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jestie on a day certain.</p>
               <p>If the cause of summons be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Lord Chancellor or by any other whom the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he concludes his speech with the Kings commandement to the Commons to chuse their Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, without removing from his place to confer first with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, or with the Commissioners if the King be absent.</p>
               <p>The Commons being thereupon assembled in their house, one of the Commons putteth the rest in mind of their charge given in the upper house, touching the chusing of a Speaker: And then doth of himself commend one unto them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth their opinions to be signified by their affirmative or negative voices: And if any man stand up and speak against him so named al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging some reason, he ought to name another.</p>
               <p>When it appeareth who is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, after a good pause he standeth up and sheweth what abilities are required in the speaker, and that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93671:84"/> there are divers amongst them well furnished with such qualities, &amp;c. disableth himself, and prayeth a new choice to be made, which is commonly answered with a full consent of voices upon his name.</p>
               <p>After which two go unto him in the place where he sits, take him by the Arms, and lead him to the Chair, after a while he riseth, and uncovered, with humble thanks for their good opinion of him, promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his willing endeavour to do them service, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then some and commonly (he that first spake) puts them in mind of the day to present him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The mace is not carryed before him, untill his return, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the King and allowed of.</p>
               <p>Here may be 2 questions mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether the Commons might chuse their Speaker if the King commands them not?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the election be in their own absolute choice?</p>
               <p>For to clear these two we might
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93671:85"/> view the ancient Records, those of <hi>R.</hi> 2 are the first that mention their Speaker.</p>
               <p>It doth not appear by any of them, that the Commons had ever had any such commandement to chuse their Speaker, neither is a Word of it in any Record of <hi>E.</hi> 3 which have the speeches at large touching the cause of summons most of them concluding with a charge of the Commons to consider and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise thereof amongst themselves but nothing touching the Election of their Speaker.</p>
               <p>Yet out of doubt they did first choose their Speaker, before they entred into any debate of charge.</p>
               <p>The first charge to choose their Speaker, is in <hi>Anno</hi> 2. <hi>Henry</hi> 4. but that onely excepted, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from 2 <hi>Henry</hi> 4. untill this day, and the long use hath made it so material, that without the Kings Commandement or leave, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose their Speaker, which appears plainly by this, that in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 31. <hi>H.</hi> 6. the Parliament being prorogued, and the Speaker ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93671:85"/> in execution in the <hi>interim</hi> before the access, The Commons prayed his inlargement, which after long debatement of the priviledges of Parliament was denyed, and then certain of the Lords were sent to the Commons, &amp; commanded them in the Kings Name to choose a new Speaker, and thereupon they did so.</p>
               <p>And of late years, in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Parliament being prorogued, and the Speaker dead in the <hi>interim,</hi> before the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, the Commons before they proceeded to any businesse, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Lords therewith, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the Lords to intimate to the Queen, (as shall be more largely declared hereafter in this Chapter) and so were commanded by her Majesty to choose a new Speaker.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) But as touching the second Question, surely the Elections of the Speaker was anciently free to the Commons, to choose whom they would of their own House, which appears in this, that the King never rejected any whom they made choice of.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:93671:86"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vide</hi> 5. <hi>R.</hi> 2. the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the 4th. of <hi>November,</hi> and the xxviijth. of <hi>November</hi> the Commons came and presented <hi>Sir Richard Walgrave,</hi> whom they had chosen for their Speaker, who excuseth himself, desiring to be discharged. But the King <hi>(luy Chargeast del' faire per sa legiantie)</hi> in as much as his companions had chosen him, <hi>N</hi>
                  <seg rend="sup">o</seg>. 9.</p>
               <p>Whereby it appears plainly that the choice was absolutely in their own power.</p>

               <head>The Presentment of the <hi>SPEAKER.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AT the Day appointed, his Majesty sitting in his Royal Throne, and the Lords all in their Robes.</p>
               <p>The Commons are called in, who being come, the Speaker is brought between two of them, with low obeisances to the Barr, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented at the Barr unto his Majesty:
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93671:86"/> The presentment of the Speaker is not recorded in any of the Rolles of <hi>E.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>And none of <hi>R.</hi> 2. speaks of the Kings Commandement to choose their Speaker, so that there could not be any day appointed to present him: yet I suppose the Commons did ever first present their Speaker, before they declared any thing to the King, otherwise what needed the Speakers excuse unto the King, before he was admitted to speak in the first year of <hi>R.</hi> 2. which no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord saies was a new Institution, and therefore no doubt was in use also under <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and before.</p>
               <p>From the second year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4th. and downwards, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are willed to choose their Speaker, and to present him.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The Speakers Excuse.</head>
               <p>THis is now formal and out of modesty, for he first excuseth himself unto the Commons when they elect him, and afterwards to the King when he is present.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:93671:87"/>
               <p>The first excuse that I find is that of Sir <hi>Richard Walgrave</hi> Knight, Speaker, <hi>Anno</hi> 5. <hi>R.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Whom the King charged upon his Allegiance to take it upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he was chosen by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Anno</hi> 1. <hi>Henry</hi> 4. of Sir <hi>John Chenye,</hi> who made no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse at his presentment: But the next day after he and they came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, and declared his disability to serve by reason of a sudden disease: And that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons had chosen Sir <hi>John Dorewood</hi> in his place, beseeching his Majesty to allow thereof, which the King did, and commanded Sir <hi>John Dore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> to be their Speaker, and he made the common protestation for himself, and the Commons, but no excuse <hi>no</hi> 63.</p>
               <p>The next excuse is <hi>Anno</hi> 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>N:</hi> 8. of Sir <hi>Arnold Savage,</hi> which the King would not allow of.</p>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 6. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>N.</hi> 8. Sir <hi>William Sturmy</hi> made no excuse.</p>

                  <hi>An.</hi> 7. and 8. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>N</hi>
                  <seg rend="sup">o</seg>. 9. Sir <hi>John Tiptoft</hi> desired to be excused
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93671:87"/> in respect of his youth, But the King affirmed the Election.</p>
               <p>And all other Speakers in <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. his time, desired to be excused, and some under <hi>H.</hi> 5. and some others did not; it was not constantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, but from the 6th: year of <hi>Henry</hi> 6. since which time they have all (except two) desired to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: yet none were excused save onely Sir <hi>John Popham</hi> Knight, <hi>Anno</hi> xxviij. <hi>H.</hi> 6. whom the King discharged, and thereupon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons chose, and presented <hi>William Thresham</hi> Esq who made no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, neither did Sir <hi>William Oldhall, Anno</hi> xxix. <hi>H.</hi> 6. desire to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused.</p>
               <p>At this day, the Speaker having made his excuse, the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor confers with the King, and then telleth him that his Majesty doth approve the Commons choice, and will not allow of his excuse.</p>
               <p>Then the Speaker proceeded to his speech, but anciently he made first a protestation as followeth.</p>

               <head>The <hi>SPEAKERS</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation.</head>
               <p>THe first Protestation is that of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>No.</hi> 15. yet no doubt the like was made in former times, though not entred; For I find no new Institution, or Order for this, neither could it be new, being in the beginning of the first Parliament of this young King.</p>
               <p>The words of the Protestation are these, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That what he was to say was from the whole House, and therefore required that if he should happily speak any thing without their consents, that the same might be amended before his departure from the same place, <hi>N</hi>

                  <seg rend="sup">o</seg>. 9. Sir <hi>John Tiptoft</hi> was presented and affirmed by the King, his excuse by reason of his youth being first recited, this was the second of <hi>March;</hi> on the xxviijth. day of <hi>March,</hi> he made the common Protestation, it should seem he was in good hope to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused: And therefore he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93671:88"/> of a Protestation, which he made not until he had somewhat else to speak on the behalf of the Commons, and desired a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their priviledges: on the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>April,</hi> he desired his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation to be entred, and desired also in the name of the Commons, that if they shall deliver any thing in writing, the same writing may be delivered to them again, at any time during the Parliament, to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if need be at their pleasure, unto which the King assented.</p>
               <p>At this day the Speaker wholly omits the Protestation, neither is it now needfull, for he never comes to speak on the behalf of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, unlesse to demand Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against any whom they have accused to the Lords.</p>

               <head>His Spake ancient at this day.</head>
               <p>ANciently the Speaker came not before the King, untill he had somewhat to say unto his Majesty, on the behalf of the Commons, and then having first made his Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93671:89"/> for amendment of any thing he should speak otherwise then he was directed: He proceeded to speake in the name of the Commons, and if he speak any thing of his own mind, as sometimes it hapned, he declared it so, but never made any Oration, as now of latter times.</p>
               <p>To prove all this, <hi>Vide</hi> all the Parliaments of <hi>R.</hi> 2. where the Speakers Protestation is first made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1. <hi>R.</hi> 2. His speech followes his Protestation, but it concerns not the cause of Summons, but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>dehors,</hi> so that it seems he was directed therein by the Commons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 2. <hi>R.</hi> 2. he rehearseth the Chancellors speech, and answers in the Name of the Commons, which shewes plainly the Commons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for his speech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 3. <hi>R.</hi> 2. he delivers the answer of the Commons touching the aid required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 6. <hi>R.</hi> 2. The Commons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated two days amongst themselves, of their charge touching the Kings passage into <hi>Flanders,</hi> then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired conference with the Lords,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93671:89"/> after consultation had, the Speaker came; and made his Protestation, and then delivered the Answer of the Commons, so that the Speaker came not untill the Commons had agreed what he should say. And no Record <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. mentioned either the speakers presentment or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, But the answer of the Commons when they were agreed thereon; though out of doubt the same was delivered by the Speaker onely.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, <hi>Anno</hi> xvij. <hi>R.</hi> 2. For between the 6th. and the 17. no Speaker is Recorded.</p>
               <p>The Speakers presentment and protestation are onely entred, and no speech the first day, <hi>Anno</hi> xx. <hi>&amp;</hi> xxi. <hi>Consimile.</hi>

               <p>And so in very many Parliaments of <hi>H.</hi> 4. 5 and <hi>H.</hi> 6. and <hi>E.</hi> 4. and downwards to the 6. <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Which Protestation the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons also directed, as may appear <hi>Anno</hi> xiij. <hi>H.</hi> 4. where the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker required on the behalf of the Commons, that it would please the King, that they might be advised
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93671:90"/> of their Protestations untill the next day; which plainly shewes, That the Speaker spake nothing (his excuse excepted) but what the Commons advised him.</p>

                  <hi>Vide etiam Anno</hi> 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. the Speakers Protestation being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he then of his own authority (saith the Record) rehearsed the cause of Summons.</p>
               <p>So that if he made any speech of his own he declared it so.</p>
               <p>Of latter times, the Speakers speech is what it pleaseth himself, having no direction at all from the Commons touching the same; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do now omit their ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, and in lieu thereof, make Petition to the King on the behalf of the Commons, some in generall words, for all their ancient words, and some in particular.</p>

               <p>That the Commons ever enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed those priviledges, which the Speaker now petitions for, though never desired by any of the Ancient Speakers, untill after the 7th. year of King <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>The Petitions are now three, touching their Priviledges, <hi>(viz.)</hi>

               <p>At all other times of <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. and downwards, the Commons with the Speaker were admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings presence in Parliament, to deliver their answers: And of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes under <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. and <hi>H.</hi> 6. they did propound matters to the King, which were not given them in charge to treat of.</p>
               <p>This request for access unto his

               <p>Neither was it ever denyed them, for the Commons would never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any uncomely speeches to pass of private men in their House, much lesse of the King, or of any of the Lords.</p>
               <p>They did oftentimes under <hi>E.</hi> 3. discuss and debate amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves many things concerning the Kings Prerogative.</p>
               <p>And agreed upon Petitions for Laws to be made directly against his Prerogative, as may appear by divers of the said Petitions; yet they were never interrupted in their consultations, nor received Check for the same, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear also by the answers of the said Petition.</p>

               <p>I will not alledge such prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of his time, as prove that the Commons argued and propounded matters contrary to his Prerogative; (for they are many) But onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how that King did in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of his reign, take notice of the Commons consultations in matters concerning the same.</p>

               <p>In this Parliament <hi>Sir John Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi> one of the Kings Minions being Speaker, a Bill was exhibited to the Commons, that the great and excessive charge of the Kings House be amended &amp; taken away,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93671:92"/> and taken away, and against the multitude of Bishops, and Ladies in the Kings House.</p>
               <p>No man will doubt but that <hi>Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> did presently acquaint the King with this, and it was bruited also at that very time, that the King was displeased with the Commons, for that they intended to disswade his Majesty from sending certain into <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> whereupon the Commons came before the King, and denyed there was any such speech amongst them: And yet (though this occasion was offered by themselves) the K. took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Bill touching his House, but willed the Lord Chancellor to tell them, that his Officers should come and confer with them about weighty affairs.</p>
               <p>At the Lords return from this conference, the King came into the Parliament House, and told the Lords that he understood that the Commons had (in this conference) handled some matters against his Royal Estate and Liberty, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Lord Chancellor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the same.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:93671:93"/>
               <p>Whereupon the Lord Chancellor declared Four Bills, propounded by the Commons, whereof the fourth and last was the Bills touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the excessive charge of the Kings House, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which onely displeased his Majesty, and he was highly offended that the Commons who are his subjects durst presume of any Ordinance, or government of the Kings House and Person, which he commanded the Lords to tell the Commons, and to charge the Speaker to declare his name, that exhibited the Bill: And <hi>Haxey</hi> was condemned for a Traytor for that Bill.</p>
               <p>By this you may see how the K. did cast about, to have this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter related unto him in the upper house; neither can it appear by any ancient Record, that the King did take notice of any of the Commons speeches, or consultations, until they were reported unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in open Parliament.</p>
               <p>The next precedents are of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. which are not much to be stood upon, because he was an Usurper:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93671:93"/> And therefore it behoved him to affect the love of his Commons in his time: <hi>Annis</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. The Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker told him plainly in open Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that his House was far more chargeable, but less honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then any of his Progenitors, and it was well taken by the King, whereas <hi>Haxey</hi> was condemned for a Traytor, for a lesse matter then under <hi>R.</hi> 2. yet some prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of his time do plainly prove the ancient priviledges of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: And therefore I will recite those Laws onely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>No.</hi> 11. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons petitioned the King, that he would not suffer any Report to be made unto him of any matter ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moved or debated amongst them untill they be concluded, nor give them any credit; whereunto the King assented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 9. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>No:</hi> 12. It is plain that the King is not to be told of any thing in communication with the Commons, until it be declared by themselves, which was declared to be so upon this occasion: The
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93671:94"/> Lords sent for certain of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and told them what Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidy they thought fit to give the King, and wished them to tell it their Companions, and to advise them to yield thereunto; unto which the Commons did justly take exceptions, and made complaint thereof unto his Majesty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was declared and agreed, that it is lawfull for the Lords to commune of the Subsidies by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: But neither the Lords nor the Commons are to make report thereof unto the King before they agreed: And then the same is to be declared by the Speaker in the manner accustomed. <hi>Vide Chartam de immeditat. in Schedula ibidem,</hi> If the King might not take notice of the Subsidy (about which the Lords and Commons did often confer) and being agreed, made an Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof; much less might any thing else moved amongst the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons be reported unto his Majesty, before the Commons were fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed thereon, and declared the same by their Speaker, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93671:94"/> either unto the King or Lords.</p>
               <p>The third Petition is for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Arrests.</p>
               <p>This Petition was never made untill of late dayes, yet this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge did ever belong to the Lords and Commons, and to their servants also coming to the Parliament, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, and returning home.</p>

               <p>He shall make fine and ransome unto you, &amp; render treble damages to the party grieved, <hi>R. Y.</hi> as sufficient remedy in the like Case. I have translated this Petition, or Bill exhibited by the Commons, <hi>Ad verbum,</hi> out of the Original: By this you see who are priviledged <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Lords, Knights, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and Burgesses, and their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants coming to Parliament, staying and returning.</p>
               <p>The Petition is to have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of this Priviledge punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Fine and Ransome to the King, &amp; treble damages to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty grieved, had sufficient Remedie.</p>
               <p>What Remedy this was doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Earl of <hi>Cornewalls</hi> case, <hi>Anno</hi> xviij. <hi>Ed.</hi> iij. <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the party contemning the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Parliament is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to prison, to make Fine and Ransome to the King, to render to the party grieved damages, as the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93671:96"/> Lords of the Parliament shall award; And to answer the Kings Steward and Marshall, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt be committed within the Verge, for the wrong done to them, which is a greater punishment then the Commons required; And hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily they know it not.</p>
               <p>But this being the ancient Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and done by Prescription, The Lords thought it more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to retain it, then to Enact a new Law to punish the contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their priviledges, as if they had not been otherwise able to do it of themselves, or had no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy before, but were subject to scorn and contempt.</p>
               <p>As the offender was punished, so the party arrested was set at liberty: And this was so notorious, that the Commons (at that time) desired no redresse therein by their Petition.</p>
               <p>It rests to shew how the party so arrested, was set at Liberty, which shall follow: but here first occurs another Petition of the Commons, touching assaults during the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>(viz.)</hi>

               <p>The 14. of <hi>March An.</hi> 15. 25. The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the King to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> sitting, the Parliament House was moved to take the same into their consideration, and so to proceed therein as they might give
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93671:99"/> no just offence unto his Majestie, and yet preserve the priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>The Lord Keeper of the great seal thereupon signified to the house that he was commanded to deliver this message from his Majestie unto their Lordships <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was restrained for a misdemeanor, which was personal to his Majestie, and lay in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per knowledge of his Majestie, and had no relation to matters of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the house was put to a Committee, and being resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the Lords Committees for priviledges, &amp;c. were appointed to search for precedents concerning the Commitment.

               <p>To meet when they please, and to report when they were ready for it, and their Lordships think fit, for the consideration of the house.</p>
               <p>The 25 of <hi>March</hi> 1625 the Lord

               <p>Whereas by a motion made by one of your Lordships,<note place="margin">Priviledges.</note> the Lord Keeper did yesterday deliver a message from his Majestie, that the Earl of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel</hi> was restrayned for a misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor which was personal to his Majestie, &amp; lay in the proper know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Majestie, and had no relation to matters of Parliament: his Majestie hath now commanded me to signifie to your Lordships, that he doth avow the message in sort as it was delivered to have been done punctually according to his Majesties own direction: And he knoweth that he hath therein done justly and not diminished the priviledge of that house.</p>
               <p>And because the Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed yesterday to search for precedents, &amp;c. had not yet made any report to the house, therefore direction of this business was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for this time.</p>
               <p>The 5. of <hi>April</hi> the Earl of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> made this report to the house

               <p>The first question that did arise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them was, whether that proxies are of any validity which are deputed to any Peere who sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not in Parliament himself, and it was conceived that those votes were lost; whereupon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee found this trust to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of five suffrages, by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> unto whom they were entrusted; and the Commitee finding by the Journal book that the Sub-commitee (which was appointed to search for Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for priviledges concerning the Commitment of a Peer in time of Parliament) had not yet made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to this house; they therefore conferring their notes of prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents together whereof they had made search, they have found no one Peer to have been committed (the Parliament sitting) without tryal, or judgment of Peers of Parliament, and that one only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:93671:100"/> in the book Case of King <hi>E.</hi> 3. which was here urged, cannot be proved to be in Parliament time: and this the Lords of the grand Committee thought fit to offer to the consideration of the House.</p>

And that the said sub-Committee may make their report unto the House at the next access.</p>

               <head>Touching Imprisonment or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of Lords in time of Parliament.</head>
               <p>UNder <hi>E.</hi> 1. the priviledges of the Lords of Parliament was such, that although the power of the Church was so great, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be scarce less then the highest temporal power; yet when <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of Cornwall in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament time was by it cited by a process from the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> which was far less then any imprisonment, he recovered 1000 marks Damages against <hi>Bogo de Clare,</hi> that procured the citation, and both this <hi>Bogo</hi> and the Pryor of <hi>Sanct. Trinity</hi> that served it, were fined in great sums to the King for the contempt also against him in the citation.</p>
               <p>The Case of the Arch-bishop <hi>Stafford,</hi> in the 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable here, it appears that though he were commanded to stay from the Parliament untill he had ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered certain Articles in the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93671:102"/> Exchequer touching accompt, yet by a dutifull standing on his right, he did get his place in the House, and so sensible were the Lords of that breach of their priviledge in that restraint of this Arch-Bishop, that they declared that none of them ought to be questioned but in Parliament, and to that purpose also an Act passed that year, though with the rest of that year it now stands repealed.</p>
               <p>Between the Parliaments of 50 and 51 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>William Wickham</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winton</hi> was called to an account for divers monys that he had received of the King, and some other matter, and his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porallities were seised, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> in the Kings name, he was not to come neer the King by twenty Miles: This was in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. in <hi>Hillarii</hi> 51 a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament was held where the Bishops and the Clergy that then were a third state of the Parliament (as they are called frequently in the ancient time) being present, to give
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93671:102"/> the King a supply, made their complaint to the Arch Bishop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> as the chief of them <hi>(de injuria illata eorum confratri &amp; Corpor.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93671:103"/> the Lords that were absent might be sent for: But it was answered, that it would be too long a delay of the Parliament, but such as were neer should be sent for: The Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Ruthin</hi> being impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Owen Glendor</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Commons conceived they had so much interest in the presence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Lord there, that they petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the King to give the Lords of <hi>Roose,</hi> and <hi>Willoghby,</hi> leave to provide his ransome, which was 10000 Marks, which was granted.</p>
               <p>A bill passed both the houses in the 5. <hi>h.</hi> 4. wherein it is affirmed that according to the Custom of the Realm, the Lords, Knights, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and Burgesses and their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants coming to the Parliament, and there staying and returning home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ought not to be arrested or in any manner imprisoned in the mean time for any debt, accounts, tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, or other contract whatsoever. It was desired, that if any did offend against the priviledge, he should suffer fine and ransom, and pay treble damages: But the Kings An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93671:103"/> is, that they had sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in <hi>le cas,</hi> for there was no doubt made of the Priviledge, though a desire were, of a greater Remedy then the law had yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided:</p>
               <p>The Commons the 8 <hi>h.</hi> 6. in their bill for <hi>Lark</hi> a servant of Mr. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> a Burgesse of Parliament (which passed both houses of Parliament) affirm, that the priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were clear that no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was to be arrested in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-time, But for Treason, Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or surety of the peace.</p>
               <p>It was resolved, upon great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, 31. <hi>H.</hi> 6. that no member was to be arrested, saving in cases of Treason, Felony, breach of the Peace, or upon a condemnation had before the Parliament, which (as the Law is to this day) must be understood of an arrest of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner, upon an execution before his time of priviledge in Parliament: in the xxxiij. <hi>H.</hi> 8. The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his speech touching <hi>Ferrers</hi> Case (that being a Burgess was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Execution) but discharged
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93671:104"/> by Order of the Commons House) saies that his learned Council had enformed him, that all Acts and Processe, coming out of any other inferiour Courts, must for the time cease, and give place to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the highest; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever offence or injury is in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament-time offered to the meanest Member of the House, is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged as done both against the King, and the whole Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>And the chief Justice Sir <hi>Edward Mountague,</hi> and the rest of the Judges, confirmed with divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons all that the King said to that purpose.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis Bishop, though all were granted to be true that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> saith of him, was not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the time of Parliament.</p>
               <p>But after the Parliament ended, and that both for misprision of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and for Treason.</p>
               <p>First, one of his offences is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have been the denying to take an oath of Supremacy ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 222. for the defence of that Act, the refusall whereof was misprision by the same Act.</p>
               <p>But the first time this Oath was offered to any man, was the very first day of the Parliament, that is the 30th of <hi>March</hi> when the Form of it was made, and remains yet in the Journall of that year, so that his refusall of that Oath must be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the very last day, on which it seems it was not: Because he is not mentioned in the Journal to have been there present, or after
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93671:108"/> the end of the Parliament; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time never was any man put to swear that Oath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to this offence is added in <hi>Martin,</hi> that he contested, and protested against the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touching the dissolution of the Marriage of the Queen <hi>Katherin,</hi> and the confirmation of that with Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> for which he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and suffered as a Traytor: But untill a moneth after the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was not treason to do any Act against the second Marriage, as appeareth in the body of that statute: And after the moneth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that is from <hi>May</hi> following, it was by that statute made Treason to do any Act in derogation of it: so that neither his misprision of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor his Treason for which <hi>Martin</hi> saith he was committed, nor his commitment could fall in the time of the Parliament; nor doth <hi>Martin,</hi> nor any other say so, nor doth the Journall that hath not his name in that parliament prove any such matter, for in that very Journall divers Lords names are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93671:108"/> omitted, that no man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive stood there at that same time committed, yet perhaps there was reason enough to have committed him in the Parliament time also, for he stood then very much suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Treason, as we may see by the Act of the said Parliament, wherein he was attainted of mispri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Treason.</p>
               <p>But the truth of the Case is, that the Relation of it in <hi>Martin</hi> is false here as it is delivered,<note place="margin">25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> &amp; divers mistake it, that wrote before him, this Bishop was not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that year at all, for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not committed, but in 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. he was attained by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of misprision for refusing the oath, and thereupon committed; and in the 27th. year of <hi>H.</hi> 8. he was attainted for speaking trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous words against the Stat. of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13.</p>

               <p>IN that Case, for so much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes Commitment, (which is the onely question now agitated) it appears expresly, that when it was in question, (before the particular acccusations that the Commons put up against him) whether he should be commited by reason of a general fame raised against him, the Lords onely determined, that he ought not yet to be committed.</p>

At the request of the Commons, it is said he was committed to the Tower; but the Roll mentions not by whom: But howsoever, there is nothing in that Proceeding concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Commitment, that shews he was
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93671:109"/> at all committed for any less offence then Treason. And before the charge of Treason laid against him, the Lords alone determined, whether he should be committed or no. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, the Commons put in two bills of Accusation against him, one of divers Treasons, the other of offences of like nature. And he is by Writ brought from the Tower to answer, and then desires copies of the accusations, which are gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him: And the King, by advice of all the Lords, then committed him to the Award of three Esquires,<note place="margin">Ibid. 48.</note> to be kept in a Tower at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the Kings judging of him in time of Parliament, which is the point objected, the Case goes on thus:</p>
               <p>The 13 of <hi>March,</hi> which was four days after, he made his answer to divers particulars, the King and the Lords sitting in Parliament.</p>
               <p>The 14 being <hi>Saturday,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. Act. 50.52.</note> the Chief Justice, by the Kings command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, remembred all the Lords of what was done the day before in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93671:110"/> this matter, and asked, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they would therein give to the King. At which time they defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their advice until the <hi>Munday</hi> following: But on <hi>Munday</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing was done; and on <hi>Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> the King sent for the Lord Chancellour, and all the Lords that were in Town, to his Palace at <hi>Westminster;</hi> and when they were all assembled, he sent for the Duke also, who came and denied divers of the offences, and submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self wholly to the Kings Rule and Government, to do with him as he list.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the Lord Chancellour, by the Kings Commandment, told him,<note place="margin">Ibed. Act. 50, &amp; 52.</note> That he conceived that the Duke not putting him on his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, had submitted himself wholly to the Kings Rules and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; wherefore touching the Treason, the King held him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clear nor guilty. And touching the other offences, the King by force of his submission (as the words of the Roll are) by his own advise, and not reporting him to the advice
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93671:110"/> of his Lords, nor by way of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for he is not in place of Judgement) putteth you to his Rule and Governance (that is to say) that you before the first of <hi>May</hi> next coming, shall absent your self out of this Realm of <hi>England</hi> for five years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And instantly upon this so sayed by the Chancellour, the Viscount <hi>Beaumount</hi> on the behalf of all the Lords, and by their advice, assent and desire, declared, That this that was so decreed and done by him, concerning the person of the said Duke, proceeded not by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and counsel, but was done by the Kings own Demeanance and Rule, and desires that this may be entred in the Parliament Roll, with this Protestation, That it should not be, nor turn in prejudice nor derogation of them, or their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but they may have, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their liberty and freedom in case of their Parage hereafter, as freely and largely as ever they, or any of their Ancestors or Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors had and enjoyed before his time.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:93671:111"/>
               <p>Upon this it is now objected, that the King here judged him, and the Lords demanded him not. But it is first plain, that it is no judgement at all: The Chancellour says ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, it was neither by way of judgement, nor in place of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A judgement could not be so given against him, neither was it any legal banishment; for by the ordinary course of the Common Law, there is no punishment by banishment; and that which hath been in examples, hath been by judgement given in Parliament; as appears in that famous case of the Dukes of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Norfolk</hi> under <hi>R.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And for the Lords demanding him, there was no need at all or colour why they should have demanded his person, for he was not restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from them. He was extraju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially bid absent himself, onely out of the Kingdom, and of his own will to obey the King; which while he was about to do, he was taken upon the Sea, and there slain; and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93671:111"/> for the matter of judgement &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding against him, which should otherwise have been before the Lords against him, they sufficiently saved their right, by protesting first, that all that was done to the Duke by the King, was onely by the Kings own Demeanance and Rule, and that this should not prejudice their right of Parage, or their <hi>(Jus Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis)</hi> which is their right of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as Peers, as it is called in the Protestation of the Clergy, when they left the house, because they would not be party to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of blood, in the 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> TO this the Answer is full, that the latter part of the Bill doth comprehend more then it was fit the Royal assent should have been given unto, and more then was, or at this day is the Law of Parliament.</p>
               <p>For it is, that no Member of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther House, be arrested or detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in prison during the Parliament, saving in these three cases. To be arrested, is to be taken with Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers by Process, or otherwise.</p>
               <p>To be detained in prison, is to be detained after an Arrest, though in truth it be none: So that the Bill is desired, not onely that none should be arrested or detained upon Arrest during the Parliament, which is the onely priviledge supposed in the body of the Bill; but also, that none should be detained in prison during the Parliament; whereas there is no doubt, but that any of the House of Commons, or their servants, or the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93671:112"/> servants of Lords being detained in prison, upon an Execution served upon them, before the time of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Parliament; or being in Execution by any other ordinary course of Justice before that time, ought to be detained still, as it is practised still at this day. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly also a fourth Limitation is added to those three in the 13 <hi>H.</hi> 6. in <hi>Thorps</hi> Case, where Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Felony, Surety of the peace, and condemnation before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, are the causes excepted; so that there being more asked by the Bill, then the priviledge of Parliament allowed, there was reason enough why the King assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not unto it.</p>

               <p>The 21. of <hi>May</hi> 1626. the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident reported the Kings Answer unto the Petition, from the House touching the Earl of <hi>Arundel (viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lords, I did little look for such a Message from the House, I have been of the House, and did never know such a Message from the one House to the other: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when I receive a Message fit to come from you to your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, you shall receive an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
               <p>The Lord President further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that the Lords Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, appointed to deliver the said Petition unto the King, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon withdraw, and required him (the Lord President) hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to desire his Majesty to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to let them know, unto what poynt of the said Petition he takes this Exception.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The exception the King taketh, is at the peremptoriness of the Termes, (to have a present An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer) and the King wonders at their impatience, since he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised them an answer in conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the House altered their former Petition, leaving out the word (present,) and appointed the former Committee, humbly to deliver the same to his Majesty, at such time as the Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> shall signify unto them, when his Majesty will be pleased to admit them to his presence.</p>
               <p>The 14. of <hi>May</hi> 1626. The Lord President reported the Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer unto the petition of this house concerning the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> (viz)</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Kings Answer,</note>My Lords, I see that in your peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you acknowledge me a King of as much goodness as ever King was, for which I thank you, and I will endeavour by the grace of God never to deserve other: But in this I observe that you contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict your selves, for if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me to be such as you say I am, you have no reason to mistrust the sincerity of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; for whereas upon often petitions made by you to me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this business, I have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to give to you a full answer with all convenient speed; by this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Importuning me, you seem to mistrust my former promises. It may be said, here is an emergent cause, for that I have delivered a Member of the lower house: in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93671:123"/> this my Lords, by your favour, you are mistaken, for the Causes do no waies agree; for that he that was commited of the house of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was committed for words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before both houses, which being such as I had just cause to commit him; yet because I found that they might be words only misplaced, and not ill meant, and were so conceived by many honest men, I was contented upon his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to release him without any sute from the lower house; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as my Lord of <hi>Arundels</hi> fault was directly against my self, having no relation to the Parliament: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I see you are so impatient, I will make you a fuller answer then yet I have done, not doubting but that you will rest contented with that. It is true, I have Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for a cause which most of you know, and though it hath been no more, I had reason to do it; yet my Lords, I assure you I have things of greater importance to lay to his charge, which you must excuse me not to tell you at this time, because
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93671:124"/> it is not yet ripe, and it would much prejudice my service to do it, and this, by the word of a King, I do not speak to delay you, but as soon as it is possible you shall know the cause, which is such that I know you will not judge to be any breach of your priviledges; for my Lords, by this I do not mean to shew the power of a King in dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of your priviledges.</p>

               <p>This being read the second time, the house was moved that all bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness might be layed aside, and consideration might be had how their priviledges may be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto posterity, and the house being put into a Committee for the freer debate thereof, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards resumed, it was ordered the house to be adjourned till to morrow, and all businesses to Cease.</p>

                  <hi>An.</hi> 17. <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>no.</hi> 35. it is enacted that <hi>John Attwill</hi> a Burgess for <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> being condemned during the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the Exchequer upon 8 se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral informations, by the pursute of <hi>John Taylor</hi> of the same Town, shall have as many writs of <hi>superse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> therefore, as he will until his coming home.</p>
               <p>Here ariseth a doubt whether the party priviledged might be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the execution without an
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93671:129"/> Act of Parliament, that is without the consent of both Houses and the King.</p>
               <p>There may be much dispute upon this question, the strongest allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against it is, that it will preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the Plaintifs execution; but since the party priviledged is not to be arrested for any debt, Trespass, or contract, <hi>prout An.</hi> 5. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>no.</hi> 7. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedicto,</hi> none can be arrested during the Parliament, but for Treason, Felony, or breach of the peace, <hi>prout An.</hi> 8. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>no.</hi> 57. My opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that the arrest upon an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for debt, trespass, or contract, is meerly void: And then it can be no prejudice to the Plaintif, but he may have a new execution after the end of the Parliament; so that an Act to deliver him that is so arrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or to save the Plaintifs rights for a new execution, is <hi>(ex abundanti,)</hi> and needless.</p>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93671:130"/> should be released of all such arrests, and make an <hi>Attorny,</hi> so they may have their freedome and liberty freely to attend upon the Parliament</p>
               <p>And under correction be it spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, the declaration of the Judges in <hi>Thorps</hi> Case being Speaker, and arrested in the interim after the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment of Parliament, <hi>An.</hi> 31. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>(viz.)</hi> that there is no gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>supersedeas</hi> to surcease all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, must be understood for all time and not for all process, and thereby to exempt executions, and their declaration at that time also, that if any person that is a Member of this high Court of Parliament be arrested in such Cases as be not for Treason, or Felony, or security of the peace, or for a condemnation had before the Parliament, that is used in all such persons, shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased of such arrests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot be understood to except arrests up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on execution sitting the Parliament, but of such arrests in the interim between the adjournment and the accesse as <hi>Thorps</hi> was; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93671:130"/> to say that the priviledge is from arrests for debt, is meer fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, and but a shew of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and no priviledge in deed: and whereas the Judges did then further declare, that it is used that all persons should be released upon such arrests, and make an Attorny, so they may have their freedome and liberty ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attend upon the Parliament: I am of opinion that in such Cases they did not use to make an Attour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at all, for the partie had a <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeas</hi> to stay all proceedings against him; for it is a breach of priviledge to Commence but a suite in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment time against a Member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or else <hi>Bogo de Clare,</hi> had not been punished for citing the Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> whereas he might appear by a Proctor, <hi>An.</hi> 8. <hi>E.</hi> 1. nor had the Master of the Temple his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion been denyed to distrain upon a house of the Bishop of Saint <hi>Davids</hi> in Parliament time, whereas the Bishops might make an Attorny to prosecute a <hi>Replevin, An. eodem E.</hi> 1. nor would King <hi>E.</hi> 2. have
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93671:131"/> commanded by Proclamation that the Justices of Assize should <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federe,</hi> where Barons or other Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to Parliament were parties, they then not being arrested, but Defendants only; It is not enough that a Member of Parliament be free in person onely, but in mind also; but how can his mind be free if he be subject to Suits and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and being arrested in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be without remedy for his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, unless by a solemn Act made by consent of King, Lords, and Commons; so that I conclude, leaving others to their own sense in this poynt, That all arrests upon Execution are meerly void in this case; that the party so arrested might be set at liberty by a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeas</hi> out of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and that such deliverance is no prejudice to the Plaintiff, the former arrest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none, but meerly void.</p>
               <p>But if you demand for ancient precedents, I answer, there are none recorded, for that the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeas</hi> was granted of course, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due) and needed no Petition
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93671:131"/> for it, yet there are Precedents of latter times to prove it directly, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ex Journal. Domus Communium Die Mercurij,</hi> 22. Februarii, <hi>Anno</hi> 18. <hi>Eliz.</hi> report was made by Mr. <hi>Attorny</hi> of the Dutchy, upon the Committee for the delivery of Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> man, <hi>Edward Smalleye,</hi> arrested upon Execution, that the said Committees sound no Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the setting at large by the Mace, any person in arrest, (but only by Writ) and that by divers Precedents of Record perused by the said Commitees, it appeareth, that every Knight, Citizen, and Burgess of this house, which doth require priviledge, hath used in that case to take a corporal Oath before the Lord Chancellour, or Lord Keeper of the great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for the time being: That the party for whom such Writ is pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, came up with him, and was his servant at the time of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest made, and thereupon Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> was moved by the house, that he should repair to the Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93671:132"/> and make Oath in form afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and then to proceed to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a Warrant, for a Writ of priviledge for the said servant, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the said Report of the said former Precedent.</p>
               <p>By this appears the remedy for their liberties out of Arrests, and that Executions are not exempted, for Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> his man was then in Execution, as appears afterwards in the same Journall: I find not the Burgesse did take an Oath in case of priviledge for his own liberty, happily the Sheriffs return, or a certificate thereof was sufficient.</p>
               <p>The Writ of priviledge being so easie to be had, what needed any Petitions to be made by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the King, and the Lords for the same? And as there is no Precedent for this in the time of <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. nor <hi>H.</hi> 5. so there are none to the contrary, and the Lords in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, did usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of their own authority deliver their servants out of Execution if arrested in Parliament time.</p>
               <p>But now this doubt is cleared by
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93671:132"/> the statute of <hi>Anno</hi> 1: <hi>Jacobi, Cap.</hi> 13. for new Executions to be had against such as are delivered out of Execution by priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for discharge of them, out of whose custody they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, which statute notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing saith, that it was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely doubted of, whether such deliverance by priviledge of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament were prejudical to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff or no.</p>

               <p>The reason of this short time, for the deliverie of Petitions, was for that the Parliament did seldome last many dayes: And therefore they were then appointed also on the first day of the Parliament, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was afterwards adjourned to another day.</p>

               <p>Here you see that the petitions are to rest under the Seals of the Tryers, and in the Custody of the Clerks (that is of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) until they be answered, and then to be sent from Day to Day, as they are answered unto the Chancery.</p>
               <p>Except the petitions <hi>Corum Rege,</hi> that is, those that required the Kings Grace, they were to be tryed before the King, and to rest in the mean time under the Seals of the Auditors <hi>(viz)</hi> the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>

               <p>The Clerk of the privy Seal by vertue of this Writ brings in the said writing, which being examined and delivered in full Parliament, it was considered by the Lords and Commons that it was contrary to the Laws of the Land, and all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and therefore it was damned, <hi>per agarde del Parliament,</hi> And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it unto the said <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> By this Petition you may perceive that what was done in full Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is so recorded.</p>
               <p>So the long Petition of <hi>Gee Staun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton An.</hi> 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. was viewed and read in full Parliament, and assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto by all in full Parliament: It was to demand Judgment in a Case depending in the Common pleas, which was of such difficulty for point in Law, that the Judges did forbear to proceed, and so the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:93671:147"/> Lords of Parliament directed them on which side to give Judgement.</p>
               <p>Note, that the Commons Joined with the Lords to damn the recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of <hi>Elizabeth de Burgo,</hi> and so it was necessarily to avoid a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; but the Commons did not join in assent touching <hi>G. de Stantons</hi> Petition, for there the Lords did but direct Justice to be done in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Court.</p>
               <p>In the time of <hi>R.</hi> 2. the Petitions were directed sometimes to the King, and his Councel, as in Ed. 3.</p>

               <p>Answered thus.</p>
               <p>The petition being read in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the reasons of the one side, and on the other, and of all the Feoffees present in Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard, it was awarded by the King and all the Lords, that the said <hi>Thomas Swinbourn</hi> shall make full restitution, &amp;c.

               <p>Some to the Lords alone.</p>

               <p>That presently after the said <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie</hi> made, he and his wife were disseised by <hi>Richard Cleydon:</hi> and the said <hi>Agnes</hi> his Concubine, who was a Nunne professed, and by <hi>Tho.

                  </gap> for which they have been in suite these 15 years, and are like to be utterly disinherited, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The answer is thus endorsed, Let this Petition be delivered in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, and let the Chancellor by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament cause the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to come before him in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, and there the matter compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93671:153"/> in this petition be diligently viewed and examined, the reasons of the one part, and the other heard; let that be done by authority of Parliament, which right and reason <hi>(&amp; bone foy bone conscience)</hi> requires in the case. I may doubt whether these words, by authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were added to countenance this answer or no; for if they had omitted them yet the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor was directed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to proceed, and his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings warranted thereby I find divers other Petitions so answered this Parliament, but not all.</p>
               <p>Divers other Peritions were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to be determined in the Chancery that year, but they were such as could not be determined by the Common Law without these words, <hi>per authoritatem parliamenti prout,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The answer is, let this petition be delivered in the Chancery, and the Justices and the Kings Serjeants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called, and the matter well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, let that be done which right and reason demands.</p>
               <p>But in the following times most Petitions have the same words by authority of Parliament.</p>
               <p>And it seems to be, that they were added, for that the parties were thereby directed to the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</p>

               <p>Whereas the said Bill or Petition is not by the Commons of the Land, required to be affirmed or assented unto.</p>
               <p>That no men to such a Bill or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition (unless the assent, or request of the Commons be endorsed) be bound to answer contrary to the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I intend to expatiate: But more particularly of the original cause of their institution or creation. For the performance of that task which I have voluntarily imposed upon my self, I have dived into the depth of civil knowledge, and pried into the <hi>Arcana</hi> of Philosophy; collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatsoever hath been related, penned, or experimentally known heretofore, either by Academick Learning, Parliaments in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweals, Policy in Government, or History.</p>
            <p>But to begin: Man, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Creation, was not made a Citizen or Inhabitant of this World only, but Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount over all Creatures that have
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:93671:168"/> a being within the compass of the terrestrial Globe: This authority and dignity was conferred upon him by the supreme Governour of Heaven and Earth, who hath des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended so far below his sacred Self, as to make him his Co-partner in Government, adorning him with divine understand; to the intent, that the Scepter of this terrene Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire may be swayed by his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Counsel. The cause of this co-union of Government between God and Man, proceeds from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; which being perfect, makes Man capable of imitating Almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; so that it appears, there is a kind of near alliance or consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity between the Creator and the Creature, who sometimes is made God's Vicegerent upon earth: yet without divine assistance, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or counsel can be termed good, or perfect: For, the seed of this glimmering resemblance of a Deity planted in Man, if it light on fertile ground, and that happen to meet with good culture, produceth a crop according to the expectation of the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:93671:169"/> Coelestial Planter; otherwise, it is like corn cast into a barren soyl; whose product is nothing but bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, thorns, or thistles. Thus then Man being reduced to a sense or feeling of those sparks of divinity that lie latent in him, should be wrought to a perswasion, that he hath the Character or <hi>Idaea</hi> of a Deity in his mind; the impression of the Creator's holy Image stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his soul; and ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to be so industrious in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of his talent, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his affairs, that his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may speak him worthy, in some sense, of so heavenly a favour bestowed on him. Yet, though he be made God's associate (as it were) he must return him the glory, to whom it properly and primarily belongs; and acknowledge all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to flow from him, as from the Fountain: For, as brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are not governed by Animals, but by an Herdsman; no more can Man rule or govern Man, without the assistance and protection of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence divine. And should any
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:93671:169"/> man be so sordidly ignorant, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistically prophane, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Government of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or Nation, without divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or assistance; it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follow, that that State, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, or Kingdom, and every Member thereof, be implunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Ocean of misery and infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For, it is in vain to build upon the imagined welfare of a State, or Kingdom, if God be not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and Patron thereof. It is then as conspicuous as the Meridian Sun, that all vertue, wisdom and goodness owes its original to God; which did instigate the pur-blind, or rather pure-blind Heathen, that had only the rush-candle of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to consecrate publicke Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to Vertue, Faith, Concord, Wisdom, Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if <hi>Ovid</hi> the Ethnick durst be so bold, well may we then <hi>à fortiori</hi> affirm, and maintain,
<q>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:93671:170"/>
                  <l>Est Deus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo;</l>
                  <l>Spiritus hic sacrae lumina mentis ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore our duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the deserving a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble title than that of meer Man, and strenuously to labour in the pursuit of Understanding, that flies a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pitch, than either humanity or morality dare aspire unto; that so, if possible, we may surpass all our Ancestors, and live according to the dictates of that which hath the greatest supremacy in us, <hi>viz.</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; by vertue whereof, we are made sensible of a Deity, know how to exercise Vertue, embrace that which is good, and avoid what is evil: this is that which endows a man with the qualifications of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Valour, and Justice; by this we are able to discern, that the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Globe is wheel'd about by divine wisdom; it is this that makes a man Noble, a <hi>Hero:</hi> which was the reason that the Lacedaemonians
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:93671:170"/> imposed the title of Gods upon those persons, that were judged to move in the highest sphear of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; <hi>homines de meliore luto;</hi> men of a more noble allay, than dull mud-wall'd man can boast of: Nay <hi>Homer</hi> defies <hi>Hector</hi> in this ensuing Distich:
<q>
                  <l>Non hominis certe mortalis filius ille</l>
                  <l>Esse videtur, sed divino semine natus.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So that we may maintain (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being Paradoxical) that that man, who is guided by solid reason in all his words and actions, is <hi>quasi semi-deus inter mortales;</hi> Demi-god among men.</p>
            <p>Now, of such repute is a grave Counsellor; who hath reason for his Cynosure, and wisdom, his co-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutress in all undertakings. Such persons are so necessary in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, that they can by no means be omitted or left out: For, the King being but a single person, cannot have an eye unto all the transactions of his Kingdom; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, sometimes it happens, that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:93671:171"/> he is seduced from the conduct of reason, by yeilding to his affections, yet the Senate, elected according to the Law of the Land, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted or made up of vertuous, sober, grave, discreet persons, do from their place, as from a <hi>Pharos,</hi> or Watch-tower, look about them, and provide all things requisite for the discreet and well regulating of the State wherein they live; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting all mutinies, seditions and and dissentions that the rebellious rabble durst any waies attempt: Of such great use and necessity are they, and that not only to the King, but the people also; like unto the vital part of mans soul, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding in the heart, enliveneth and quickens that which partakes of Reason, and is situated in the head: and a Monarch that is guided by the advice and councel of a grave Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, rules his Kingdom prudently, ly, and governs it discreetly. For, as reason in all her proceedings, makes use of the service of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; yet she alone determines, and deserves the greatest honour and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93671:171"/> esteem: so a Prince, though he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Counsel, is to be judged the wisest; and is uncontroulable in all his actions: for it is a Maxim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, that <hi>The King can do no wrong.</hi> And as the hand distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed into fingers is thereby streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thned, and made the more apt to lay hold on any thing; so he that governeth with the aid and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Counsel, shall manage all affairs with the greater considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prudence. Their original did proceed from the benefit that it was imagined would accrue to the Commonwealth, whereof they were members, by their counsel: And although they, that first assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled men into Cities, who before like Savages, ranged over the woods, and inhabited the desarts dispersedly, without either Law or Order, first gained the Title of Kings; yet that course alone could not make them understand the duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Allegiance they owed unto their Soveraign: wherefore perceiving, that when they were civilized, and reduced from their brutality, the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:93671:172"/> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a single Person was not of sufficiency to curb and check them in the full career of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancies, they judged it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have assi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tance from serious and grave Counsellors: which we find performed by <hi>Romulus</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to-basileus,</hi> or first King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; who supposing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a single Person without a Senate to be perilous and unsafe, made a Convocation of 100 Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who out of respect to their gray heads, and grave understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, obtained the name of <hi>Patres. Theopompus</hi> also, King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> trod the same path; For, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and invested them with eminent authority: where at his wife being offended, was so pragmatical as to tell him, That he had derogated from his dignity, and clipt the wing of his ensuing Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by diminishing their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and supremacy: But he replied, like himself, That the Counsel and gravity of a Senate would fortifie his Kingdom, and be instead of a Bulwark against the impious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:93671:172"/> and plots of rebellious Subjects. Whereby it is apparent, that Monarchs first embraced Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors out of necessity: and all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional men are of opinion, that those State-transactions are most firm and solid, that are digested by the wisdom of a Parliament, ere they come to a publick birth. Now, I call that a Parliament, or Senate, which by Royal Authority, and the general consent of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is freely elected, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, to advise and govern the State; and consequently, a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or Parliament-man, is one lawfully chosen into the number of those that are authorized to sit at the helm, and steer the Ship of State. And it hath ever been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that they were alwaies the most grave, discreet, and noble sort of Subjects; because there is no Society of Men, or Nation, how barbarous and brutish soever, but will voluntarily and cordially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that the Government should be imposed upon, and rest in those persons that are vertuous; and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:93671:173"/> think it just and reasonable to obey them. Nor are there any so fit to govern, as the ancient, experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, which are usually chosen; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause others, either through want of maturity or experience, are usually withdrawn by their juvenile phancies, and recreations, from such serious places of authority: but a grave Counsellor is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed or discomposed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant affection, transported by appetite, or inveigled by youth; but by Reason directed, by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel fortified, and by Age made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And further, Philosophers maintain, that in all things there are three degrees; Great, Small, and Indifferent: And that is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the most perfect, that partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates of either, and stands in an <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibrium</hi> between two: Now, the Senator standing as a mean or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator between the King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Monarch and his Subjects; may be the more intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the perfection of all things; and study what is the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a King, and the duty and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:93671:173"/> of a Subject; with the Rights, Properties, Liberties, and Laws appertaining to both; and so advise them accordingly; that the King may not turn tyrannical for want of Counsel, nor the people transcend the bounds of a moderate becoming liberty: Therefore he must of necessity be a man of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent endowments, a clear intellect, and a piercing understanding, to dive into the intricacies of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Scipio</hi> saith, That as the end of Mariners, and their laborious endeavours, tends to a safe arrival into the intended Haven; the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians skill and art is employed for the recovering and preserving health in his distempered Patients; and the Captains valour levels at victory: So the happiness of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, their glory, life, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty should be the <hi>summa totalis,</hi> or chiefest end that our Counsellor should aime at; all which he must labour to preserve, maintain and augment, by his industry and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to the utmost extent of his ability; and leave no stone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:93671:174"/> for the benefit of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, of which he is a Member. Nor is it my design to broach any new-fangled opinion, or to phancie a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> or make my brain the womb or <hi>Idaea</hi> of an Utopian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor, that can only be imagined, and not found <hi>in esse</hi> (as <hi>Plato</hi> did in his Commonwealth, and <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Orator) but my discourse tendeth to a relation and descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such Persons as have liv'd heretofore, and <hi>citra omnis contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versiae aleam,</hi> may be hereafter. And as divine <hi>Plato</hi> composed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all those things into order, that might conduce to the felicity of his City, or Republick; the same course will we take in the Character of our Counsellor: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perswade your self to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at, or come to some famous <hi>Emporium,</hi> or <hi>Piazza;</hi> whereunto all persons, of all Nations, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Cities repair; and we will disrobe every single person of some Vertue, Law, Custome, or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, that shall seem most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious and beneficial to our enterprize; and therewith make
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:93671:174"/> up our Sage Senator, Grave Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor, or Perfect Politician: that they, who for the future are inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with such eminent dignity and authority, may imitate our Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and endeavour to be adorned with these ensuing qualifications.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more clear, than that the Supreme Power, among many other gifts, hath conferr'd that of Reason upon Man, to the end that by vertue thereof, he may pry into the nature of Coelestial, as well as Terrestrial bodies; and thereby honour, reverence, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Creator.</p>
            <p>Now, he that is sensible of the gifts of God, and the benefits of Nature; and doth, both by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and action, employ this supernatural gift, slowly Apes the Deity, and thereby resembles him, as much as comes within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of mortality. But, they that contrary to Nature, and the end of their Creation, indulge their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, delighting themselves in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, neglecting, or totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting Reason; <hi>Facie tantum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:93671:175"/> homines sunt, non animo:</hi> carry only the outward aspect or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of a Man; because they are destitute of his more noble endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Hence ariseth the variety of mens natures and dispositions, or rather conditions: for, some are born Free, Noble, Wise, and with an aptitude to govern; others, Vassals, Rusticks, Ideots, predestinated to servitude and bondage: All Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, being willing and ready to submit to the Government of the more grave and wise; promoting, &amp; accumulating honours on them, and Offices, with reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect suitable to their deserving gravity and understanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> is of opinion, that God in mans first Creation, did by his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscience so order it, that in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of those that are destin'd and adapted to govern, he hath distill'd some drams of gold in their composition; and in them that are to assist Kings and Superiours by their deliberate counsel, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture advice, silver; but the Nature
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:93671:175"/> of Peasants and Mechanicks is tempered with Brass and Iron. Which similitude the Philosopher extends to the manners, nature, and capacitie of man.</p>
            <p>For, although every man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally desireth, that the issue of his loyns may resemble him; yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, though seldom, it happens contrary to his expectation: for Gold sometimes produceth Silver, a more inferiour metal. Therefore it is requisite, that a Prince should be capable of understanding the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural disposition and inclination of his Royal Off-spring, that their Iron may be converted into the Gold of a more noble disposition: but, if neither good Education, Documents nor Precepts can ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon their inclinations, so as to cause a Metamorphosis, or Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation; the Government must be transferr'd to those, whose wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom renders them more capable. For, it hath been prognosticated, and the event hath been experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally known to succeed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Prediction; That they
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:93671:176"/> that are ruled by ignorant, mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Governours, come to ruine, destruction, and confusion. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all which misfortunes, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, that our Counsellor be a natural Subject of that place or Country where he governeth; no forreigner: of the same Country, because that birth and being do not only oblige, but induce a man to believe, that it is honourable, just, and requisite for him to spend his bloud in defence thereof, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is offered: <hi>Dulce &amp; decorum est pro patria mori;</hi> It is a sweet and comely thing to die for ones Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And how can it be that any man, of what constitution soever, should not affect that place wherein his Parents, Neighbours, Friends, and Allies reside; and that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to which he is indebted for his Life, Name, and Honour, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing else that is either for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or necessity? <hi>Non nobis enim nati sumus</hi> (saith the Orator) <hi>sed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae;</hi> Our Country challengeth the greatest part of us. And it is most certain, that Nature hath so deeply
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:93671:176"/> rooted the affection to their native place in the mind of man, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any good Subject timorous, or unwilling to lay down his life, and hazard his fortunes in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, if necessity required. Nay, it hath been so prevalent, that the most impious and unnatural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that endeavoured the subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the place of their nativity, the very sight of their native soyl hath prevented their cruel enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. <hi>Veturia</hi> did disswade her Son <hi>Martius</hi> besieging <hi>Rome,</hi> only by reducing to his memory the love and respect he ought to bear to his natural Country; branding him with the name of impious and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious, for being so highly ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, as to disturb the quiet of that City wherein he was begot and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated; altogether unmindful of his Wife, Children, and friends that remained there. So notable was the piety of <hi>Veturia</hi> to her Country, and no less was that of her Son in forgiving it; which had been somewhat ingrateful to him at that time, through the cruelty
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:93671:177"/> of the Tribunes persecuting the Nobility. <hi>Sertorius</hi> also entreated <hi>Pompeius</hi> and <hi>Metellus</hi> to endeavour the procurement of his revocation; alledging that he took it for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter piece of honour to have the name of an obscure Roman Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, than that of Emperour in any other place of the habitable World. Well then might <hi>Naso</hi> sing,
<q>
                  <l>Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctas</l>
                  <l>Ducit, &amp; immemores non sinit esse sui.</l>
               </q> The Obligation that devoteth and bindeth us to our Country, is great, upon this account; because our goods, persons and fortunes are therein contained. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (as it is reported by divine <hi>Plato</hi>) judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it a crime of as deep a dye, to be guilty of ingratitude to the place of ones nativity, as to ones own Mother, to whom we are indebted for being: Nor can there be an offence so hainous, but the affection to our native Country should allay
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:93671:177"/> and mitigate. Our Counsellor must be of natural birth, no Forreiner; because their counsel or advice is thought and accounted suspicious and dangerous; which was the reason that mov'd the <hi>Athenians</hi> not only to exclude strangers from their Council, but to drive them out of their Cities, lest they should aspire at the diginity of Magistracy, and instigate or work upon the minds of Citizens, so as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to Innovation; and so mutation of Laws, Customs and manners might ensue, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Seditions and Rebellions. Which method the Venetians have diligently observed; for, it is their study, and their whole industry, to prevent their sitting among them in Council, lest they intruding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a false name or title, should arrive to dignity and eminency in the Republick. Besides, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite he be of the Nobility; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of honest Parents; because honest parents produce honest chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for the most part. He must be of the number of noble and free
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:93671:178"/> Citizens, who assumes his title from that Nobility that owes its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal to Vertue; which he may partly challenge as his own, and partly as his Ancestors. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that are nobilitated and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with their own peculiar ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as well as with those of their Predecessors, merit esteem, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, honour and fame, above all others, and are to be highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced; and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Vertuous and good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, have a generous, good, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and noble Issue: according to the Lyrick Poet,
<q>
                  <l>Fortes fortibus creantur, &amp; bonis,</l>
                  <l>Est in jumentis, est in equis Patrum</l>
                  <l>Virtus, nec imbellem feroces</l>
                  <l>Progenerant aquilae columbam.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth) that person that comes of a noble race, is the stem of a noble stock, and hath the affluence of Fortune ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Vertue, hath arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the apex or perfection, the very Quintessence of true Nobility.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:93671:178"/> But, because it is a rarity to find one person adorned with them all; Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue alone can by her own right and property <hi>nobilitare viros.</hi> As for revenues, large acres, specious and spacious Mannors, but no manners, and the honour that we challenge from our Ancestors, without ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, they are so far from being ornaments, that they prove a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement and a stain to the Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Such persons render the name of their Predecessors obscure; And through the vices of their Posterity, are entombed in the grave of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion: Therefore it is better to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend the top of Nobility by a man's own vertue (saith the fluent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor) than to be reputed for the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion conceived of his Ancestors; because the Beginner of Nobility deserves most praise and applause. He that is the off-spring of a noble Family, deserves honour and esteem undoutedly, with this proviso, that he make it the Butt and End of his Endeavours and Industry, to equal, if not excel, the Vertues of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Predecessors, and to gain
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:93671:179"/> unto himself more vertuous and glorious Attributes. And infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are they to be commended that do so; for they are so far from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuring the Fame and Renown of their Fore-fathers, that they add a most resplendent lustre to it by their own vertue yet verdant and blossoming. The Law of the <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> is worthy of commendation; for they enacted, that those chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that did lead a debauched life, not imitating the vertues of their Parents, should be utterly disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited, and their Lands by a Deed of gift freely disposed of to the most vertuous of the Race or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is an office of piety, to leave unto Posterity a demonstration of our gratitude and thankfulness to our Ancestors, whose heirs we are, not only of their external substance (the goods of fortune, I mean) but of their virtue, glory and renown, which is the true inheritance, and the best of all terrene possessions. For, 'tis not a stately Building hung within with coats of Arms, and badges of the honour of others, nor
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:93671:179"/> the vast unmeasurable pieces of Land belonging thereunto, but Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that Nobilitates; As <hi>Jevenal</hi> sings,
<q>
                  <l>Tota licet veteres exornent undique cerae</l>
                  <l>Atria, Nobilitas sola est, atque unica virtus.</l>
               </q> For, wheresoever Vertue is resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it deserves more ample com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation than Fortune can lay claim to, because she refuseth none, but may be by every one embraced, she dwels in the homely Peasants Cottage, as well as in the Princes stately Palace; and we find the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bak'd Peasant adorn'd with russet-honesty, when the gaudy fantastick Lord oft-times is so vitious, that he is a stranger both to vertue and honesty. <hi>Cleanthes</hi> was a poor wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-drawer; and, though his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side might seem rough-hewn, and he despicable and contemptible to one whose sight pries no farther than the external part: yet his mind was refin'd, and his intellect
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:93671:180"/> ennobled with such faculties as will speak him Man, to an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing person, maugre all the force and violence of Poverty or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: Nor did Vertue find <hi>Plato</hi> noble, but made him so. And it is most certain, that from Bondmen Kings have descended, and the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of Kings hath been enslaved: such revolutions, long tract of time, by the assistance of fickle fortune, doth produce: for, according to the Poet,

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Who therefore may be termed noble? He that by nature is made vertuous, and qualified or adorned with the attribute of wisdom. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as the exercise of our quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is various, so are the degrees of Nobility. The Nobility of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate persons, that lead a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative life only, may be called Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Nobility; but the same in those that gain glory and renown by their sage and wise Counsel in behalf of the Commonwealth, or that manifest themselves stout and valiant in managing war for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Country, is termed Civil Nobility. The force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of this Nobility extends to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, and engraves or make <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numentum aere perennius;</hi> That is,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:93671:181"/> armour of proof against the iron teeth of time; <hi>Quod nec Jovis ira, nec ignis, Nec poterit ferrum, nec edax abolere vetustas.</hi> By these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of Fame and Vertue, men are stimulated and spurred on to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and exceed the vertue of all their Predecessors. And as in every Republick there are two kinds of Time, the one of Peace, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of War: so the Citizens are of two sorts; the one fitted for Peace, &amp; the other adapted for War: The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by Arms doth enlarge the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories &amp; bounds of his native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or at least defend them from the invasion of forraign enemies; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e counsel and grave ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice doth rule and preserve it invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable. Wherefore, a Common wealth should be composed of these two sorts of men: for, as in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement &amp; proceedings of State-affairs, action followeth consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is inferior to it; so those persons, by whose mature counsel and deliberate advice the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was quietly, peaceably and discreetly governed, were of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter esteem than those that en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arged
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:93671:181"/> the Confines thereof by War and Arms. <hi>Homer,</hi> the Prince of Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Poets, produceth <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> saying, He could sooner surprize and subjugate the City of <hi>Troy</hi> by the advice of ten <hi>Nestors</hi> or <hi>Ʋlysses,</hi> than by the valour of twice as many <hi>Ajaces</hi> or <hi>Achilles. Pyrrhus</hi> likewise was heard to use this expression frequently, That <hi>Cineas</hi> by his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence had won more Cities, than he with all his men of War had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conquered. But, he that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in wisdom and martial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, deserves the Crown and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour above all: and though, as we said before, it is Vertue that makes a man Noble, without the additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal riches of Fortune; yet it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite our Counsellor should be wealthy; because thereby he may be able to supply his Country, if compelled to wage war; for money is the sinews and strength of war. But good education, saith <hi>Plato,</hi> is the basis and foundation of solid wisdom and prudence. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore requisite, that from their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years they be instructed in all things that conduce to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:93671:182"/> of man, <hi>è cunabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> as we say, even from the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and swathing clouts, for then are they most apt to imbibe and suck in the most wholesome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that shall be exhibited unto them: for then <hi>anima est quasi ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula rasa,</hi> like a blank or piece of clean white paper, capable of any vertuous or noble impression. And as it behoveth a Republick to be stored with knowing Subjects, so ought they to be diligent in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and provide them good Tutors, that may instruct them, and chalk them out the way of Vertue. For, as a good husbandman dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently pruneth his plants, and lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth off the superfluous branches, when the season requires it, that they may grow the faster; so the Commonwealth, that may justly be termed the Parent and housewife of Subjects, ought to be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diligent to provide for the careful and vertuous education of youth, by lopping off the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous branches of vice, and engrafting them on the stock of Vertue. The
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:93671:182"/>
               <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> use to elect Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates out of the number of their grave, wise and sober Citizens, and call them publike Tutors, which might serve to educate and train up their younglings; and were always reverenced by them, being judged vertuous men in action, and well skill'd in military discipline. And the ancient Romans were as strict and careful in this point of education, as the <hi>Lacedaemonians. Cato</hi> was so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the nurture and education of his Son, that he disdained not to receive him into his tuition, and take him into his pupillage or guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian ship as soon as ever ripeness of age had fitted him for instruction. And although at that very time he kept <hi>Chilo</hi> the Grammarian, and one excellent in that art, in his house, to instruct his Children, yet he had not permission to correct them, but that was left to the discretion of the Father. Besides, he disdained to be engaged to a School-master for the instruction of his Children altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; wherefore he taught them the Laws, manners and Customes of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:93671:183"/> his own as well as other Nations; as also, how to dart, handle his Arms, swim, (which was anciently much in esteem; for, <hi>Aristotle</hi> when he would set forth an absolute <hi>Dulman</hi> or <hi>Ignaro,</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he could neither read nor swim,) and to endure both heat and cold, that he might be hardened and seasoned for any enterprize. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he penn'd a History with his own hands, and committed it to the perusal of his Son, that he might therein see and understand the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick deeds and actions of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, and be instructed in the art of Government. He never spake any unclean or passionate word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Son, but was as circumspect in his language, as if the Vestal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins or Priests were in presence; observing that ancient rule,
<q>
                  <l>Nil dicta foedum, factuve haec limina tangat</l>
                  <l>Intra quae puer est—</l>
               </q> And this was the oeconomique or domestique discipline of <hi>Cato,</hi> and of the major part of the Romans, especially of the better sort, in the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:93671:183"/> education of their Children. In like manner the Philosophers of <hi>Greece</hi> composed plaies for the instruction of youth; which is preserved to this very day among us, (though that custome for some years was almost obsolete and out of request.) Nor were they only capable of indoctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating, or laying down the tenets that are necessary to a happy and good life, but they were of ability to instruct in the Laws and manner of Government: Yea, this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age hath some Seminaries of Learning and Vertue (according to the Graecian custome) the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> (though lately ready to expire, and almost demolished by the Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who hated all book-learning (as they term it) because their crimes were so hainous, that they went beyond the mercy of the book.) Hither Youth might resort, as unto a Harvest of Science and Knowledge, and might reap a crop of Vertue and good Discipline. But it were to be wish'd, that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Tutors in our Universities, would instruct their Pupils in the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:93671:184"/> art of living, and not disputing well altogether, (for, so might they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve preferment from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all solid persons,) and not take more delight in hearing a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicator or Jester, than a solid Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher. In ancient times, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers enjoyned their Pupils si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and taught it also; but our modern wits teach them only to talk or discourse; which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Nation is filled with so many worded Orators, and prating Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers. They endeavor not, <hi>nunc dierum,</hi> to refine the understanding, but to cloath the tongue with fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy language; and are applauded for alteration and strength of wit in their publike arguments, but not for modesty or solid wisdom: yet there is hope of a reformation in these Schools of Learning, when those loyal Spirits, that for their Allegiance to their Soveraign were dismissed, are re-instated. The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Graecian Academies were the Nurseries of Commonweals; and out of them (as from the Trojan Horse) issued most excellent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:93671:184"/> stout Captains, and wise Governors. <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> with whose Fame the whole World hath ecchoed, had their primitive education in Schools of Literature; and many others, which I omit. Thus it is apparent, that men ought to be trained up in Schools, that so they may be instructed in the Principles of Government: wherefore it ought to be the care of every State, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick and Kingdom, that their Seminaries of Learning be as well furnished &amp; stored with Vertues, as the Citizens shops are with wares and commodities. Now then, we see that good education is requisite, and accomplisheth our Senator. Besides, he must have an inclination to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; for if not, his evil disposition will hardly be bettered by Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy: for, the nature of man prompts him to evil; and he finding himself strengthned with the Science of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, is more expert, and gains more skill to palliate and plead for his bad actions: for the best of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces possessed by a man of an evil dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, is depraved, and, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to its own nature, is a help to, and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:93671:185"/> promoter of evil counsel. So that it may be maintained, that good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction bestowed upon an evill nature, is oftentimes ill employed, and ineffectual. Though it is most certain, that Education prevails much with tender years, changing it from vice, and molding it accor- to the form of Vertue. <hi>Diogenes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded, How a man might lead a peaceable and quiet life; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, first, He must fear the Deity, who is the Author of all felicity Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, He must bestow good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation on his Children, the want whereof makes them enemies, and disrespectful to their aged Parents. Thirdly, He must avoid ingratitude to his friends, which of all crimes is the most odious &amp; comprehensive, containing within it self a whole bundle of offences. <hi>Ingratum dixeris, &amp; omnia dixeris.</hi> Mention but Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and you have epitomized all sins in a word. Moreover, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that Children be instructed in the rudiments of Grammar, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick and Logick, whereby they may understand the property of speech, and the excellency thereof,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:93671:185"/> as also defend it by argumentation. Thus may he understand the Art of Eloquence, which is perfected by use, discourse, and surveying the works of Poets and Orators; and being thus instructed, he will shake off those petty inconsiderable things that are understood by every mean capacity, and take into consideration matters of greater weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>

               <head>Of Travel; the Age, Gravity, and Election of a Senator.</head>
               <p>The major part of the wisdom of a Counsellor consists in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Manners, Laws and Customs of all Nations; which is best attained by forrain Travel, as <hi>Homer</hi> sings of <hi>Ʋlysses,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Dic mihi Musa virum captae post tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora Trojae,</l>
                     <l>Qui mores hominum multorum vidit, &amp; urbes.</l>
                  </q> And indeed, there is nothing accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishes a man more than forrain Travel. <hi>In motu melas.</hi> There is a
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:93671:186"/> certain kind of harmony in motion. And as the Master of Eloquence hath it, <hi>Plebeiae sane sunt istae animae, quae suis affixae trabibus domi resident; illa divinior, quae coelum imitatur, &amp; gaudet motu.</hi> Those are dunghil spirits, that live confin'd to the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row round of the place of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; and that foul is of a more noble allay, that like the Heavens rejoyceth in motion. Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> writes, that a mans best friends in Travel is his coyn: yet under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, notwithstanding the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of so learned a Grandee, if a man be accompanied with too many of these friends, his journey will be <hi>motus trepidationis;</hi> for according to the nipping Satyrist,
<q>
                     <l>Pauca licet portes argenti vascula puri;</l>
                     <l>Nocte iter ingressus gladium, contum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que timebis,</l>
                     <l>Et motae ad Lunam trepidabis arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis umbram.</l>
                  </q> Whereas, as he immediately affirms,
<q>Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:93671:186"/>
               <p>The indigent Traveller shall sing before a <hi>Qui va la?</hi> or High-way-man. Yet would not we have our Counsellor so destitute of money, as thereby to expose himself to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and distress; but so handsomly accommodated, as that he may take a survey of all Countries with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and credit. Yet in travelling, he must be very careful that he only come over again furnished and full fraughted with those Laws and Customes that are honest and civil, and leave those that are erroneous and evill behind him. For,
<q>Terras, non animos mutant, qui trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare currant.</q> Or at least they should do so, and not like some green heads that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt themselves, and learn nothing but the superstitious Idolatrous ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of other Countries, and be sure to retain what is bad, though it prove to their own prejudice and ruine. He must be very exact in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himself what Laws, Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, what order of life, mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Discipline, civil Government,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:93671:187"/> &amp; domestical life is in every Nation practised. He shall take particular notice of the situation of Countries and places, the building of Cities, their Fortification, Strength and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition. Let him also understand the vertue of every Prince; how his People stand affected to him, and upon what terms; the wisdom of their Senate, the form and method of their Consultations, as far as without prejudice to himself it may be pried into; the nature and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the people; what vertues they adhere to, and what vices they are most addicted unto; what Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, Souldiers and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are in every Country to be found out; that so by the report of them to his own Nation, the best precepts may be cull'd out, and the rest rejected. Yet he must take heed, lest by the new-fangled fashions that he brings over, he make not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple effeminate, and careless of their own Laws, Customs, and ancient vertues: for as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith truly, <hi>Est natura hominum novitatis avida:</hi> Man's nature prompts him to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Novelty, which oftentimes
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:93671:187"/> proves pernicious, and tends to the molestation of the Kingdom, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, or State. Many famous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have taken delight in travel, as <hi>Nestor, Menelaus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, out of love thereunto, <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily passed his time away, travelled all over <hi>Aegypt, Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia;</hi> thereby hoping to obtain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that so their minds being stored with variety of observation, they might be the more accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and remain content with their own fortune. The words that <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus</hi> reports to be written upon the Tomb of <hi>Osiris,</hi> are worthy the quotation and remembrance; which are these, or to this effect: <hi>Osiris Rex sum, Saturni antiquior fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, qui nullum orbis locum reliqui, quem non attigerim discens ea omnia, quae generi humano utilia sunt, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaria.</hi> But if he want money to support him in travel, let him em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his time in the study of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, and Cosmography: And a smack he may have of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy; but to consume much time in that Science, is judg'd, by some,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:93671:188"/> superfluous in a Senator. The field of knowledge is unmeasurable and infinite; which was the reason that men applied themselves to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Art or Science. <hi>Aliquis in Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,</hi> and <hi>nullus in singulis,</hi> is no fit Motto for a Counsellor. Wherefore, we commit to the Jurisdiction of our Senator two sorts of Countries; the one is that which containeth both God and Man (not as if we prescribed God his place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence, but we speak here according to vulgar capacities) not limited within the bounds of <hi>Europe, Asia</hi> or <hi>Africa;</hi> but is only surrounded by the posting Sun. The other is the place that Nature hath destined for his residence or being, as <hi>England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. For it belongs unto him to take a survey of the order &amp; nature of the <hi>Macrócofm,</hi> the universal World, which the Latines call, <hi>Majorem Mundum;</hi> as well as the <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosme,</hi> or little World, where he hath his habitation and abode, which they term, <hi>Minorem mundum.</hi> And when the mind is dismanacled of those worldly incumbrances which
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:93671:188"/> usually adhere to the body, and by Travel and Science is perfected, as much as lies within the verge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to be; she officiates as she ought, affecting Vertue, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affecting Vice, suppressing the lusty insurrections of the flesh, and like a Monarch curbing and giving Laws to all exorbitant affections. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the mind hath pried into the nature of the Heavens, confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their harmonious motion, knows the circumference of the Earth, her Longitude, Latitude, and the rarities contained therein; hath plough'd the furrow'd Ocean, and seen the wonders of the deep, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands their causes, beginnings and ends; what is the order and beauty of the glimmering Lights of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and what influence they have upon sublunary bodies: what causeth the passions or <hi>deliquia</hi> of the two Grand Luminaries, the Sun and Moon; the reason of their Rising and Setting, their Diurnal, Noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and horary motion; what is the generation and corruption of all things; what the nature of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of Animals, and the vertue
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:93671:189"/> and beauty of that innumerable number of fragrant herbs that usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally adorn the Earth; when, I say, all these things are understood by one single person, and God acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Supreme Author and Governour of them all; shall not that Person be judged a Prince, rather than a meer Inhabitant or Citizen of the World, that is of so profound and polite an understanding? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yes. <hi>Socrates,</hi> who by the Oracle at <hi>Delphos</hi> was pronounced the wisest of Ethnicks, being demanded what Countryman he was; replied, <hi>A man of the World;</hi> not confining himself to any particular place or Country; for he thought himself to be an universal Prince. The same <hi>Laertius</hi> reports of that Tub-hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Cynick <hi>Diogenes. Omne solum forti patria,</hi> is an old saying; and <hi>Omne solum sapienti patria,</hi> carries as much truth with it, as the former antiquity. The whole World is a Wise man's Country: 'Tis a City that comes not under the tyrannous scourge of any <hi>Nero, Domitian,</hi> or <hi>Caligula;</hi> Nor can be environ'd with walls, but is surrounded with the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:93671:189"/> universal Circle, governed by a comly order, and natural <hi>decorum,</hi> as it were with a Law certain and inviolable, palizadoed with no other fortifications than the Elements. The Citizens or Inhabitants of this place are termed Philosophers, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only by themselves, fortified with invincible minds, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently arm'd against the griping talons of penury, or any other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune that can seize upon man. Such Persons (nay, Princes as these, I may say, without entrenching on the Royal Charter of Kings) no fury of War can terrifie, no Faggot frighten, nor Axe disturb; for they are all valiant, resolute, &amp; beyond the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Fortune.</p>
               <p>Now, to the Age and Gravity of our Senator. They that have pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any thing of the life of man, did usually confine it to a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time. <hi>Plato</hi> assigneth eighty one years: <hi>Solon,</hi> eighty; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affirm, that the continuance of mans life extends but to seventy, referring all to the number seven, because it frequently falls out, that every seventh year some alteration
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:93671:190"/> or change appears in the body. The first seven years, Childrens teeth fall out; The next seven, their hair grows; The third, their body comes to its proper stature and height; The fourth, they encrease in bulk and thickness; The fifth, they arrive at their full strength and virility; The sixth, they find themselves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to pleasure and delight; The seventh, they come to the maturity and ripeness of wit and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; The eighth, they begin to be termed aged, or ancient; The ninth, weak and feeble, beholding to the support of the staff, and the help of Spectacles; And the tenth, they have one foot in the grave, and are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be <hi>è peculio Proserpinae,</hi> of <hi>Proserpina</hi>'s fold. Others there are, who maintain that this change hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens every ninth year, and so ascribe the alteration thereof to every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal number till twenty and one. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the silent, called the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of mans Age fatal, divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into four times twenty, as followeth: Childhood, continues till twenty; Youth, other twenty; Man's estate, the other twenty; and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:93671:190"/> old Age, the fourth, which puts a period to all. Some again compare Mans Age to the four Seasons of the Year: Childhood, is compared to the Spring; Youth, to Summer; Manhood, to Autumn; and Old-Age, to Winter. <hi>Varro</hi> divides Man's Age into four degrees, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends every of them within the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fifteen: Childhood (saith he) last till fifteen, for so long Children are weak and tender; Youth, till thirty, because till that Age men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and grow in height and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Ripe Age till forty five, for so long strength of body continues, and men are then fit to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in publike affairs, Old-Age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at sixty, and then the body is impotent, crazy and decay'd; so that they are not fit for State em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, lingring, and consuming till death come and trip up their heels, as he did all their Ancestors before them. To this division of mans Age we assent; but the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by number doth principally belong to Physicians; for they in exhibiting their medicines, observe certain critical daies. But our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:93671:191"/> is, that the forty fifth year of man's age is most suitable for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation; because then the strength both of body and mind is arrived to the very height. Besides, it is the middle age of Man; and at that time, if ever, the mind is perfect in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and experience, less attracted with brutish affections and desires, and least of all transported with rage, fury, or passion. When old <hi>Rome</hi> was in her glory, and shone with all her splendor, Senators were chosen at that Age, being then most perfect in body and mind: yet dare we not deny, but that some men may be termed Aged at thirty; that is, are both prudent, grave and wise. And we find upon record, that some, though very few, were created Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators by the Romans before the thirtieth year of their Age; which we do not disallow, in regard that men may be reputed ancient for vertue as well as number of years: yet care must be taken that the Kingdom be governed chiefly by mature and grave Head-pieces; for as <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirms, that Kingdom is most happy that hath store of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:93671:191"/> young mens Lances, and old mens Laws. Pertinent is that of <hi>Euripides</hi> to this purpose: <hi>Dictum est vetustum facta Juvenum, caeterum magis valent concilia Senum.</hi> In <hi>Athens</hi> no person was created Senator before he was fifty years old. And in <hi>Rome</hi> it was permitted for any man of sixty to enter the Senate-house, though he never came to the Senatorship by choice or election; and after that year, it was left to his pleasure to be present or absent; so that they did neither bind him to, nor bar him from c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ming to Council. A good, though ancient Custom; for every man, though he hath seen as many Winters as hoary-headed <hi>Noster,</hi> ought to employ himself <hi>pro posse suo,</hi> according to his utmost ability, for the benefit of his native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. <hi>Plato</hi> is of opinion, that men must learn till Age snow white hairs upon their heads. <hi>Nulla dies sine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea;</hi> that day is lost, in which a man hath not better'd his knowledge. Yet we prohibit decrepit, doting persons, whose judgements are as crazy as their bodies; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because their counsels and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:93671:192"/> consultations are for the most part dubious, and are rather hesitant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures than solid counsels, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning every Sentence with perhaps, perchance, peradventure, and the like: and this they do, as being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of their former imbecility and weakness, and so are unwilling to suffer a relapse into their juvenile and youthful errours and mistakes. Yet, if they have only so many years over their heads as may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them grave, solid and wise, they are perfect in uttering their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits; for by use and experience) which is the best School-Mistris) they have gain'd, as it were, a third eye, whereby they are enabled to pry into, and discern with the more vivacity, the events and causes of things. And as every man is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by his speech, so is the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and wisdom of a Senator ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested by uttering his opinion. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> casting his eye upon a Youth that he never had seen before, saies to him, <hi>Speak, that I may know thee:</hi> So may we say to our Counsellor, <hi>By the solidity of thy speech, and the gravity of thy deportment, manifest
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:93671:192"/> thy self unto us.</hi> Now his opinion must be delivered in significant, but plain naked terms; not daubed over <hi>fuco Rhetoricae lascivientis,</hi> with the paints of lasciviating Rhetorique, which becomes the Rhetorick School, better than the Parliament House. But so much for his Age and Gravity.</p>
               <p>Now to the Election of our Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Among the Romans (in the times of Yore Lords of the whole World) Senators were elected di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers waies; for, they were chosen either by the King, Consuls, Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Tribunes of the people, the Censors or Chieftains. And the Custome of freeborn natives is to choose Senators among themselves, or else to commit the authority of Election to a single Person, who for Wisdome, gravity and dignity is Judged the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t fit, and that is the King; Which the Romans did at first, <hi>Romulus,</hi> the first founder of their City, elected a hundred Senators; Which custome was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by their succeeding Kings. But, when Kingly Government through the insolent government
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:93671:193"/> of <hi>Tarquinius</hi> the Ravisher, was removed, this Power of election (according to the quality of the time) was somewhat changed, yet not given to a multitude; for t ll the State returned to the Basis and foundation of Government, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, Senators were elected by Consuls, Censors, Dictators, or Chieftains. In all which Elections, till the time of <hi>Augustus,</hi> there is no mention made of lots, but the Fame, Family, Order, Office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore born, riches and Possessions, were most of all considered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected. Now, since there is no earthly Possession but comes far short of Vertue for excellency in the choice of Senators, that must be chiefly look'd upon; because they are reputed Defenders of the Law, Moderators of Liberty, and Conservers of a Kingdom And as the Republick or Kingdom is oftentimes infected by the vice and impiety of Magistrates; so is it antidoted, corrected and repaired by their vertues. Such are the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of every Country, as are the Manners of their Governours; and
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:93671:193"/> the Subjects are apt to Ape the Customs and Constitutions of their Prince. It was well said of one, That the change of Princes Lives, and the alteration of Manners in Magistrates, would also work even to a mutation of the Customs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions and Rights, nay, of the Kingdome it self. And to deal really with you, evill Princes are very much to be blamed, not in that they themselves are guilty of any crime, for it is a Maxim in our Common Law, <hi>That the King can do no wrong;</hi> but that thereby the Subjects are prone to be sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and led away to the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancies; which may justly be so termed in them, though not in a King. And indeed, how can it enter within the lists of Possibility for a man to Perswade other men to be vertuous, when he himself is vicious; The Romans derided <hi>Scylla,</hi> who, though a man infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely debauched, and wholly given up to licenciousness, did nevertheless admonish and stir up others to Sobriety, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Frugality. And who
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:93671:194"/> would not blame <hi>Lisander?</hi> though he swam in a contrary stream, yet he allowed and gave toleration to the Citizens for those vices which he himself abstained from and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred. But <hi>Lycurgus</hi> deserves commendation, because he never imposed the observations of that upon any man, which he himself did not first of all diligently follow. Yet in a free State, (if any such there be) it hath been observed, they have been directed by the suffrage of chance. This order of Election is observed by that Virgin <hi>Venice.</hi> The like institution <hi>Solon</hi> authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the Athenians for the choice of the five hundred Senators: For, out of every Tribe were so many elected, as were thought to deserve that dignity; whose names were put into a Pot; and into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as many Beans, the one half white, and the other black: now so many as hapned upon the white, were pronounced Senators; and those that chanced to light on the black, were repulsed and dismissed: which made <hi>Thucydides</hi> to call that Senate, <hi>Senatum à Faba.</hi> Besides, it
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:93671:194"/> was observed among the Romans what Office he had born before his Election, and with what fidelity he had discharged himself of his duty: for they made choice of their Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors out of that number of men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that were by them styled <hi>Patres;</hi> which was, as it were, the Nursery of Counsellors, that so they might be known to be men famous for som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Among us, those that sit in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament obtain that dignity three manner of waies:

                     <item>First, By reason of their Tenure.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, By vertue of Writ; and</item>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Per Tenure</hi> are these: Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls and Barons. And these are summoned to appear before the Parliament in the space of 48. daies.</p>
               <p>They that come in <hi>per Breve,</hi> or by Writ, are these: Knights of the Shires, Burgesses, Citizens, Barons of the Cinque-Ports, and the King's Council. There come also <hi>per Breve,</hi> directed to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

The Stewards Office was to place the Lords; The Porter used to see there be but one door to enter in and go out at: And every one of the above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Officers, hath had his several Charge respectively. Thus have you had a description of our <hi>Sage Senator,</hi> of all the qualifications that tend to his accomplishment; his Duty, Dignity and Office dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played and laid open; the rewards due unto, and conferred on him; the ancient Customs of the Romans and Grecians touching this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; their election and choice; as
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:93671:195"/> also their manner of sitting in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament among us; how and by what means they obtain the Senatorship, or title of Parliament-men, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our modern styles, who were so termed, because every Member of this High and most absolute Court of Justice in <hi>England</hi> (from which there is no appeal to any other for redress) should sincerely and discreetly <hi>Parler la ment,</hi> as it is in the old Norman French, that is, freely express their minds for the benefit of the Kingdom. Nor are the Laws of this Island only, and the Liberty of the Subject conserved by Parliament, but those of all well policied Kingdoms &amp; Countries else in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Germans have their Diets; The Danes and Swedes their <hi>Riicks Dachs;</hi> The Spaniard calls his Parliament <hi>Las Cortes;</hi> And the French have (or at least should have) their Assembly of the three States, though it be now in a manner grown obsolete, because the authority thereof was by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent devolv'd upon the King: it will not be altogether impertinent to give you a succinct account of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:93671:196"/> this memorable alteration; which hapned as followeth: When our Nation had taken such large footing in <hi>France,</hi> that they advanced as for as <hi>Orleans,</hi> and had forced their then Soveragin to fly to <hi>Bourges</hi> in <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rre,</hi> for sanctuary; the Assembly of the three States not being able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene during these Pressures in full Parliament, because that by those invasions the enemy made into the very bowels of the Kingdom, the Country was altogether unpassable, so that the power that was inherent in the Parliamentary Convention, of enacting Laws, assessing the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with Taxes, subsidiary Levies, and other Impositions, was transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the King, during the rage and fury of that war only; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of long continuance, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted Authority began to grow habitual, and could never hitherto be taken from him; so that his Edicts stand in lieu of Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Out of these foregoing premises this Conclusion may easily be deduced, <q>That the principal Fountain whence the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives his happiness and safety,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:93671:196"/> is the Parliament: It is the great Conduit-Pipe which conveys unto him his Peoples bounty and gratitude; the truest Looking-glass wherein he discerns their loves. Now the Subjects love hath been ever accounted the prime Citadel of a Prince. In his Parliament he appears as the Sun in the Meridian, in the Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his Glory, in his highest State-Royal, as the Law informs us.</q> But lest we should spin out too long a thred, and so wear the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Patience thread-bare, we will conclude this first Book, and make the discourse which we allot for the scope and Subject of our next, run in another Channel.</p>
